I thought I was going to be a doctor, yet on the side, I managed to amass a good amount of experience in all sorts of technologies. While learning all of these things, I never really tried. How is this possible? A experiment with ratsAs a pre-health student, I took a class on Behavioral Neuroscience. (It continues to be my favorite college class of my career, despite my major change.) One of the topics we covered happened to be learning environments. In one experiment we covered in class, rats were placed in 3 different environments: one standard, one impoverished, and one enriched. The rats that were raised in the enriched environments made many more neural pathways than the other two. They were able to learn more because they were exposed to more stimuli. I used to be terribleI usually give two dates as the time I began programming: in elementary school, when I discovered that you could create websites for your virtual pet, and in high school, when I found the modding community for a game called Minecraft. In elementary school, I learned everything on my own. I had a book on HTML 4 by Wendy Willard and scoured Google for anything I could find about HTML, CSS, and PHP. I had no guidance and basically copied and pasted scripts to make things work. I had some okay projects out there, but overall, I didn’t really have understanding of how things worked. How I got good at programmingThings changed when I found Bukkit, a Minecraft modding community. From the forums and IRC, I met some really cool people online and created games with them. We would code together all night while sharing different ideas, techniques, and technologies. I learned even more when I found Spout, an open source Minecraft clone. I joined a “team” of developers called VolumetricPixels, which over time evolved into a sort of support group for people to talk about their projects. We discussed things ranging from Rust to managing a Jenkins CI server. The group taught me more than any of those W3Schools-like websites taught me, as I was put in an enriching environment surrounded by people who loved to code. Even better was the opportunity to contribute to the Spout project. I learned so much about 3D rendering and game engines from the incredible mentorship I received from more senior members of the community. I had people that I could talk to that would tell me where my shortcomings were, and I would improve rapidly because of it. The people who surround you determine your lifeVolumetricPixels set me on a path to become pretty good at programming, and I didn’t even realize that I was working. I was just playing around on the computer making games! The people I would talk to every day helped me realize what I could improve on, as everyone in the group had their own strengths and weaknesses. The people you talk to the most generally influence the way you think and do things, so it was no surprise that I would become a person who loves programming after spending so much time talking to other teenage developers. Choose your friends wiselyEvery single person you decide to spend your time with influences your interests and decisions. \"You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.\" -- Jim Rohn Your choice of friends and the people you surround yourself with can either make or break your success. Pick people whom you know will help you become better in what you want to do in your life, and the knowledge and “discipline” will follow. I say “discipline” in quotes because you do not feel like something is a chore when all your friends do it for fun. You don’t think of playing sports as a chore if all of your friends are doing it, despite it being exercise. Likewise, if all your friends are passionate about something and have fun doing it, you will absorb that energy and be able to love what they do as well. Hence, the secret to getting good at anything is obvious: have fun doing it and you won’t notice even how hard you’re working. The results will come in without you even realizing it.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Ruby WTF?

The days of “JavaScript sucks because it was only built in a week” have passed. One really great feature in ES6 is destructuring. In statically typed languages, one can easily know what arguments are needed in a function by the types passed into it. For example, in Java, the following function definition is very clear: 1public void sendMessage(Target target, String message); It’s obvious that the receiver of a message should be a target. In a modern IDE, calls like sendMessage(user, msg) would obviously send messages to a Target, as it is known that user would be part of a certain class. However, in JavaScript or other dynamically typed languages, things are a little harder to decipher. user may be a user id, a user object, a username, etc. Furthermore, user is a variable name, so literally anything can be passed in. A call like sendMessage(first, s) can be tricky to understand. It’s also pretty easy to swap the positions of variables, and there is no compiler to check if you are sending in the correct arguments. The SolutionOne way I’ve found to solve this problem using ES6 is function argument destructuring. In ES5, a function may look like this: 123function sendMessage(target, msg) &#123; /* ... */ &#125;sendMessage(usr, \"Hello\"); The same function using argument destructuring would look like this: 123function sendMessage(&#123; target, msg &#125;) &#123; /* ... */ &#125;sendMessage(&#123; target: usr, msg: \"Hello\" &#125;); Intent is much more clear in the second version than the first. This is very useful if you have many arguments to functions. If some are optional, you don’t even have to pass in every single argument, as arguments are not positional. For example: 12345function sendMessage(&#123; target, msg, notifySms = false, notifyEmail = false &#125;) &#123; /* ... */ &#125;sendMessage(&#123; target: usr, msg: \"Hello\" &#125;);sendMessage(&#123; target: other, msg: \"Look at your phone\", notifySms: true &#125;);sendMessage(&#123; target: other, msg: \"Look at your email\", notifyEmail: true &#125;); Now you can easily pass options into your functions without function calls having a lot of falsy/nil values.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"es6","slug":"es6","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/es6/"},{"name":"javascript","slug":"javascript","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/javascript/"}]},{"title":"Doing homework assignments in Markdown using Pandoc and LaTeX","slug":"Doing-homework-assignments-in-Markdown-using-Pandoc-and-LaTeX","date":"2015-09-13T14:57:43.000Z","updated":"2015-09-13T15:22:14.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2015/09/13/Doing-homework-assignments-in-Markdown-using-Pandoc-and-LaTeX/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2015/09/13/Doing-homework-assignments-in-Markdown-using-Pandoc-and-LaTeX/","excerpt":"","text":"Markdown is a really awesome format for text and prose. It’s really easy to manage in any text editor, and it’s quick to write. It has a lot of features, including bolding, italicizing, lists, quotes, embedded code, and more. It’s so easy to write that it’s the “language” of choice for many major websites such as StackOverflow and Reddit, it being much easier to implement and looking nicer than a WYSIWYG text editor. I’m even writing this blog post using Markdown. However, you can’t really send someone a Markdown document. It’s meant to be processed into a more readable format, most usually HTML. LaTeX is a great tool for typesetting text. It has a lot of flexibility and standardizes how documents look. It’s so powerful that it has become the defacto tool to create research papers. However, there is definitely a learning curve in using the software, and the source doesn’t look very nice. Pandoc brings the best of both worlds. It allows conversion of Markdown to a predefined LaTeX template, allowing you to use Markdown to write LaTeX documents in a format that works out 99% of the time if you’re just writing notes or submitting a linear homework assignment. Usage is simple: 1pandoc input.md -o output.(pdf|tex) This generates either a .tex or .pdf (compiled LaTeX) file that looks pretty good using the default settings. Generating PDFs quicklySince I use Markdown so much to generate PDFs, I’ve created the following shell function: 123md2pdf() &#123; pandoc $1 -o `basename $1 .md`.pdf&#125; You can add this to your .bashrc or .zshrc to add a command like follows: 1md2pdf filename.md This will generate a file named filename.pdf in your present working directory. You can use file watching tools to automatically generate a PDF and leave it open/refreshing in your PDF reader. I personally use a tool called entr(1), which can be installed via Homebrew. Writing equationsYou may want to insert some math into your document. You can do this by surrounding your math in dollar signs ($) and writing in LaTeX form, for example: 1## Euler&#39;s identity&#10;Below is Euler&#39;s identity.&#10;&#10;$e^&#123;i\\pi&#125; + 1 = 0$&#10;&#10;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet... This produces the equation inline. Documentation for this feature of Pandoc is pretty spotty — if you know of more ways to embed LaTeX equations in Pandoc-generated documents, please let me know! Setting everything upAll of the tools mentioned can be installed via Homebrew. 12brew install entr pandocbrew cask install mactex Writing Markdown instead of LaTeX allows me to iterate faster on my homework/notes and lets me worry more about my content than the formatting of my sections and subsections.

That expression is always said in today’s society, and it’s considered a good trait to have. However, many people every day work hard, yet they still find themselves struggling to pay bills or live. I don’t believe that hard work is what you should strive for. Rather, it should be valuable work. W = FdIf you still remember high school, you might remember the equation for work: Work = Force * Distance The time your work takes can be thought of like the distance component. Time is constant for everyone; everyone has it in the same amount and can choose however to spend it. We all have the same distance in the work equation. Putting a lot of time into something equates to hard work. The actual value of your time can be thought of like the force component. Just like you can apply more force when lifting something, you can learn different skills to increase how much your time work; e.g. you could learn iOS development in order to become more well rounded in order to get better jobs. Finally, the work component refers to the value of your work; it is the amount of work you output based on your time and the value of your time, the product of force times distance. Bounds to time and value of timeTime is bounded by the laws of the universe: you can only put 24 hours a day into something. You could work extremely hard, yet there is a limit to how hard you can work. On the other hand, value of time is unbounded: you can always get better at a skill or hire more people. You can end up like Mark Zuckerberg, where you’re the CEO of one of the biggest technology companies in the world and just tell people what to do, and your time is extremely valuable. Despite working extremely hard, if the value of your time is low, you won’t be able to work hard enough in order to get where you want to be. However, if you focus on maximizing the value of your time, the possibilities are limitless. Focus on increasing how good you are and how valuable you are as a person rather than spending all of your time on menial tasks just to get quick money, especially if you’re currently in school.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"Why abstraction is important when constructing algorithms","slug":"Why-abstraction-is-important-when-constructing-algorithms","date":"2015-02-02T15:09:16.000Z","updated":"2015-04-23T19:03:16.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2015/02/02/Why-abstraction-is-important-when-constructing-algorithms/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2015/02/02/Why-abstraction-is-important-when-constructing-algorithms/","excerpt":"","text":"In order to get better at algorithms (my greatest weakness), I’m currently going through the Stanford algorithm design course. To learn the concepts better, I decided to implement Karatsuba multiplication in JavaScript. (The fruits of my labor can be found on my miscellaneous algorithm GitHub repository.). This algorithm, only 43 lines, took me about an hour to code. I already knew the details of the algorithm from the video. Why? Because I was prepending the wrong number of zeroes to the number when figuring out where to split the number. Why was this happening? Originally, my prependZeroes method was being done inline, and I wasn’t testing it properly. Abstraction is important because you can test individual parts of an algorithm to make sure they are correct so you can figure out where your algorithm is failing. It also allows your code to be more symmetrical, making it a lot easier to follow. If I had abstracted the prependZeroes method and had written unit tests for that method specifically, this algorithm would have been much faster to write. Instead, I wasted a ton of time writing console.log statements in order to figure out where my bug was. Break algorithms up into as many functions/parts as possible, so you can test your algorithms much more easily.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"programming","slug":"programming","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/programming/"}]},{"title":"The real reason why Caps Lock and Escape are in terrible positions","slug":"The-real-reason-why-Caps-Lock-and-Escape-are-in-terrible-positions","date":"2015-01-08T19:41:08.000Z","updated":"2015-04-23T19:03:16.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2015/01/08/The-real-reason-why-Caps-Lock-and-Escape-are-in-terrible-positions/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2015/01/08/The-real-reason-why-Caps-Lock-and-Escape-are-in-terrible-positions/","excerpt":"","text":"It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Caps Lock key is completely useless. I use it about once or twice a year, and that definitely does not warrant it a spot right next to my pinky finger on the home row. It’s in a place that is just as convenient as the Enter key, despite being completely useless. Conversely, the Escape key is extremely useful. I use it when watching full screen videos on YouTube, closing chats on Facebook, and using commands in Vim. However, it often is in the worst spot possible to be used extremely frequently: the top left of the keyboard. And on many laptops, it’s tiny. For heavy escape users, this is an incredible boon to productivity. How Caps Lock got its prominent positionBack in the days of the typewriter, the Shift key basically shifted some mechanisms in the typewriter to allow you to type another set of characters, usually uppercase. “Shift Lock” was a toggle that basically kept the keyboard in shifted position, and it was located in the same position that Caps Lock is located on most keyboards today. When the days of computing came around, Caps Lock was moved to where the Control key now is, and the Control key was placed in the location of Caps Lock. However, the Control key was inconvenient to former typewriter users and mainframe users, and the Caps Lock key was moved pack to its original position on the 101 Enhanced Keyboard by IBM. This 101 Enhanced Keyboard soon became the de-facto standard for keyboard layouts, which is why our keyboards have this Caps Lock positioning. More info on the 101 Enhanced Keyboard can be found here. How the Escape key was placed in the worst possible positionMeanwhile, the Escape key was placed on the very far top left on the keyboard, meant to be used as much as much as the function keys. It was created in the 1960’s to allow programmers to switch from one type of code to another. However, once this made no sense for the general user, Windows began using the key to close dialogs, mostly to mean “Stop”. Other operating systems followed, and Escape became the key to exit or suspend the program in some sort of way. Why Vi uses the Escape key to switch modesIf you’re a Vi/Vim user, you probably use the Escape key quite a bit. It’s necessary to be able to any of the features of the program, and you’ll probably find yourself hitting it at least twice per minute. The positioning doesn’t make sense however, as it’s in such an awkward spot. Why not the Control key? Or the Alt key? Vi was built for a keyboard where Escape was in the position of Tab and Control was in the position of Caps Lock: the ADM-3A. This is an incredibly convenient position. You don’t have to move your hand in order to hit the key, and the key is big, unlike the tiny squares on a current laptop keyboard. It’s too bad that keyboards aren’t built like that today. Solutions?On Chromebooks, you can change your keyboard settings to map the “Search” button to the Escape key. The easiest and cheapest solution is to swap Caps Lock and Escape. On systems running the X Window System, you can put the following into ~/.Xmodmap. 12345! Swap caps lock and escaperemove Lock = Caps_Lockkeysym Escape = Caps_Lockkeysym Caps_Lock = Escapeadd Lock = Caps_Lock There are many other solutions on how to do this, but the above is the one I currently use as a Linux user. However, you still have the issue of mislabeled keys. Additionally, this fix does not work on Windows. There are several keyboards out there that you can purchase that have the keys in a nice spot, e.g. the Happy Hacking Keyboard. However, they’re usually a bit expensive as they’re produced in very limited quantities due to the low demand. Caps Lock and Escape were designed in a time where we didn’t have many of the tools we have today. They’re relics of the past that have carried on throughout computing history.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"vim","slug":"vim","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/vim/"}]},{"title":"Hacking Gmail to use custom domains for free","slug":"Hacking-GMail-to-use-custom-domains-for-free","date":"2015-01-07T19:00:22.000Z","updated":"2015-04-23T19:03:16.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2015/01/07/Hacking-GMail-to-use-custom-domains-for-free/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2015/01/07/Hacking-GMail-to-use-custom-domains-for-free/","excerpt":"","text":"It’s pretty much common knowledge that Gmail is awesome.

In this tutorial, I’ll be hooking up the AngularJS TodoMVC app to a Preston-powered backend. First, I’ve created a repo that is based off of the AngularJS Todo app. You can clone the first step like so: 12git clone https://github.com/simplyianm/todomvc-preston-angular.gitgit checkout angular This is the TodoMVC app with a few changes for simplicity: It uses a CDN rather than Bower. It uses Express to serve the app rather than being static HTML. This makes the differences between pure Angular to Angular+Preston much more pronounced. BackendTo create our backend, we must first install Mongoose, Preston, and body-parser like so: 1npm install --save preston mongoose Once this is done, we’re ready to start writing the code for our app. We’ll write all of our backend code in app.js. First, let’s require Mongoose and Preston, so we can use them in our code. 12var mongoose = require('mongoose');var preston = require('preston'); Next, let’s connect to our MongoDB database. I’m using MongoHQ since this will be on Heroku, but you can use whatever MongoDB database you want. 1mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGOHQ_URL || 'mongodb://localhost:27017'); Once Mongoose is connected, let’s define our model for our todos. We can define it like so: 1234var Todo = mongoose.model('Todo', new mongoose.Schema(&#123; title: String, completed: Boolean&#125;)); Next, let’s add Preston into this. There are only three lines of code needed to create a fully functional JSON RESTful backend with Preston: 123app.use(require('body-parser').json());preston(Todo);app.use('/api', preston.middleware()); The first line of code is required to parse the JSON request bodies which Preston depends on. The second line of code tells Preston that we want to create routes for the Todo model. By default, all 5 methods (query, create, get, update, destroy) are exposed with full access. *Note: if you don’t want this in your own application, Preston has the power to control what gets sent in every one of those methods. Read the docs for more details. The last line tells Express to serve any registered models on the /api route. Thus, routes under /api/todos are created. We’re going to add one more line of code to show what routes are created, for the sake of example: 1preston.printRoutes(); This just prints all generated routes, without their prefixes. Frontend (Angular)Fortunately, most of the AngularJS app is done. The TodoMVC example provides a sample connection to a sample RESTful backend (like ours). This is part of what makes Preston so powerful — it speaks the universal language of REST. There are tons of libraries out there to interface with REST: Restangular, restmod, etc. To get the frontend working, you must populate the todos list and ignore the 404 check. You can do this with the following: In client/js/services/todoStorage.js, make the todoStorage factory return the following: 1return $injector.get('api'); In client/js/app.js, make the resolve.store function return todoStorage. Furthermore, add the following to TodoCtrl: 12345$http.get('/api/todos').then(function(data) &#123; data.data.map(function(todo) &#123; store.todos.push(todo); &#125;);&#125;); Don’t forget to inject $http into the controller. The entire diff of these changes can be found here. If you were too lazy to follow this tutorial, you can also type git checkout master into your terminal to get to the latest version. If you’re hosting the app on Heroku, you’ll also need to type heroku addons:add mongohq to get a database hooked up to your code. The entire backend is now hooked up to Angular with little effort. Try it here! ConclusionPreston is a very powerful tool when used in conjunction with AngularJS. It can decrease the time it takes to get from idea to MVP significantly, as the backend code needed is extremely minimal. Preston solves the problem of creating a bunch of routes for your database whenever you need to create a model, as Preston just creates the most optimal routes and knows what you want. In the future, I’ll write about using Preston with Restangular, as the combination is even more powerful than using $http alone.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"MEAN","slug":"MEAN","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/MEAN/"},{"name":"Node.js","slug":"Node-js","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/Node-js/"},{"name":"preston","slug":"preston","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/preston/"},{"name":"rest","slug":"rest","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/rest/"}]},{"title":"Getting Django To Work With Vagrant","slug":"getting-django-to-work-with-vagrant","date":"2014-11-10T19:13:35.000Z","updated":"2015-04-23T19:03:16.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2014/11/10/getting-django-to-work-with-vagrant/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2014/11/10/getting-django-to-work-with-vagrant/","excerpt":"","text":"I was having problems getting Django working with Vagrant, then I stumbled upon this StackOverflow answer.

In this framework, templating is done client-side,so all the server needs to do is send data to the client via HTTP. Thus, no templatingneeds to be done on the backend and the web browser handles all of the data.All the backend needs to do is send JSON. This is awesome. Why? Because data is now separate from the view. Model-View-Controller, or MVC forshort, has long been a standard of developing web applications as it organizes codein a way that just makes sense. A controller takes a request and serves a model, thedata, and a view, which formats the data into a nice format. However, since the introduction of the iPhone, web isn’t all we have to worry about.Mobile apps are becoming almost necessary for services. Everyone does things fromtheir phone now, as not everyone wants to bring a laptop around everywhere they go. Websites are not built for mobile devices. Yes, there is responsive web design, butthat does not beat the usefulness of an app that you can just click from your homescreen. Thus, apps are a necessity. So let’s say you built a backend specific for your app. Great! But how about if youneed to deal with other platforms? For example, smart watches or smart TVs. You needto build a whole new app that may have a completely different interface. To make thiseasier, you can create an API which will make it easy to interface with your website.You can even expose this API to developers to increase adoption of your product. However, now you have this website that you simultaneously have to maintain. Everynew feature of the website has its own rendering mechanism completely separate fromthe REST API. The features of the REST API aren’t synchronized with your website. Here’s where frameworks like Angular come in. Angular can be like a mobile app,dealing directly with your API. When you build a new feature on your website, youcan also build the logic into your API, causing you to only have to write your codeONCE. Now you don’t have to worry about supporting certain operations on multipleplatforms, as you have one backend that handles all of the platforms. JSON-based backends are awesome. Logic is written once, and all you have to worry aboutis how your data is displayed. You can still support multiple platforms, but you onlyneed to write your backend logic once, as JSON is ubiquitous.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Web","slug":"Web","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Web/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"How to Have Language-Specific Settings in Vim","slug":"how-to-have-language-specific-settings-in-vim","date":"2014-04-29T01:50:27.000Z","updated":"2015-04-23T19:03:16.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2014/04/28/how-to-have-language-specific-settings-in-vim/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2014/04/28/how-to-have-language-specific-settings-in-vim/","excerpt":"","text":"I wanted to set up Vim so that Coffeescript files would use 2 spaces for indentation.

Not wanting to manage multiple servers for no reason, I set up virtual hosts, also known as vhosts. Basically, depending on what domain you visit my web server from, you will get a different website.

In this directory, you’ll see a bunch of files. Each one of these files is a config file that can be enabled or disabled individually; this is called a site.

The document root is the folder that contains the files at the root of your website. For me that’s /var/www/screenshots. Lastly, type sudo a2ensite sitename where sitename is whatever you named that file. Then, restart apache with sudo service apache2 restart, and all is well.

This service, Google Music, lets you store up to 20,000 songs with Google and lets you listen to these songs virtually anywhere. Here's how to get started. Step 1: Sign up for Google Music First you need to sign up for this service by going to the Google Music website and sign up. Step 2: Install Music Manager and choose the folders you want synced Once you sign up just click 'Upload music,' download the Music Manager, and install it. This will sync wherever your music is stored on your computer with your Google account, allowing you to listen to your music anywhere. Step 3: Install the \"Google Music\" app for Android The Google Music app, found in the Play store, allows you to listen to the music stored on your Google account. Instead of storing the music on your phone, playing a song through this app lets you stream your music from Google. There is also a handy widget that comes with the app showing you what you are listening to. Google Music is a very useful app as it frees up a large amount of space from your phone, especially if your music collection is extensive. You can also listen to your music from your computer via the Google Music website. A very awesome plus is that you can directly buy music from the Google Play store and have the music transferred to your account practically instantly -- no need to download beforehand as it's all stored with Google anyway! Enjoy having one music library available everywhere!","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[],"tags":[]},{"title":"5 Reasons Why the HTC One X is Still Better Than The iPhone 5","slug":"5-reasons-why-the-htc-one-x-is-still-better-than-the-iphone-5","date":"2012-10-03T01:21:01.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2012/10/02/5-reasons-why-the-htc-one-x-is-still-better-than-the-iphone-5/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2012/10/02/5-reasons-why-the-htc-one-x-is-still-better-than-the-iphone-5/","excerpt":"","text":"The iPhone 5 has recently been released. However, here are a few reasons why I still prefer my trusty Android phone. 1. Bigger Screen While it may not have a fancy \"Retina display,\" the HTC One X has a beautiful screen much more vivid than that of the iPhone. While the screen is less dense in pixels than the iPhone, it has more pixels (720 x 1280 vs the iPhone's 640 x 1136) and pixels are still very small. 2. Better Camera The camera of the HTC One X is 1.3 megapixels whereas the iPhone's is 1.2. The One X also has a front-facing camera like the iPhone. 3. Standard Connector The One X uses micro USB, a very standard and common connector in mobile devices, making it easy to reuse cables for other things. The iPhone 5 has a new connector which is completely unique from any other. 4. Haptic Feedback Pressing the touch screen on the HTC One X provides haptic feedback. Basically, it feels like you're pressing buttons when you type. This feedback makes it feel a lot better to type or press buttons on the touch screen. 5. Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich While it isn't the latest version of Android, Android 4.0 is still much better than iOS 6. It features widgets, typing via swiping, multitasking that lets you see your windows, and more. The Android OS is a lot more flexible and a lot better than the latest iOS which looks pretty much the same as the last version. Overall, the HTC One X is still a great competitor to the iPhone 5. It also only costs $100 + plan vs the iPhone 5's $199 + plan.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Hardware","slug":"Hardware","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Hardware/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"The Mystical Coffeescript 'by' Keyword Explained","slug":"the-mystical-coffeescript-by-keyword-explained","date":"2012-06-14T03:08:15.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2012/06/13/the-mystical-coffeescript-by-keyword-explained/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2012/06/13/the-mystical-coffeescript-by-keyword-explained/","excerpt":"","text":"Coffeescript is an amazing language. As a matter of fact, it's my favorite language. Here's some recent code I used to split up one array into a multidimensional array with a certain number of columns. [code lang=\"ruby\"] matrix.push arr[i..(i + cols - 1)] for i in [0..arr.length - 1] by cols [/code] Notice the second to last keyword: by. The `by` keyword basically changes the increment of the generated for loop. Without the `by`, you'd have `i++` as the increment of your for loop. However, with the `by`, you'd instead have `i += 3` if you had `by 3`. Here's a simple example where I am getting money out of my bank account in the form of 5 dollar bills. [code lang=\"ruby\"] console.log &quot;I have #{i} dollars.&quot; for i in [0..100] by 5 [/code] This translates to the following Javascript: [code lang=\"js\"] var i; for (i = 0; i &lt;= 100; i += 5) { console.log(&quot;I have &quot; + i + &quot; dollars.&quot;); } [/code] As you can see, the increment of the loop is now 5 rather than just 1.

They deem many tools unnecessary for projects as \"small\" as what they're doing. These tools are really actually pretty useful for solo projects, even necessary. Mistake 1: Solo programmers think of version control as a publishing system. These people write maybe 1,000 lines or more of code, then commit with a message of \"pushing version 0.3\" or something like that. First of all, the point of version control is as it says in its name -- version control of your source code. It allows you to see every individual part of your code and your thought processes at the time (via commit messages, which are important too). When you make huge commits like this, you are not allowing selected changes to be rolled back. Version control really is to manage your code's history. It's not just for showing off your code to the world. Commit early, and commit often. Don't store your work on flash drives. If you lose the drive, your project is dead. If an issue crops up, you won't be able to roll back the specific part of code that messed everything up. Instead, you'd have to change everything manually, searching for what was wrong. This wastes time and energy and produces frustration. Mistake 2: Solo programmers don't write unit tests. Programmers like this probably debug using print statements and go through the code flow. This usually happens due to laziness and/or a feeling of \"I'm the only one messing with my code, so it should work the way I made it work\". No -- this is not the answer at all. Instead of wasting time doing this, how about writing individual tests for each METHOD? Compare the actual result with the expected one and make sure the code is working properly through a myriad of use cases. Furthermore, when you change something, if something breaks, you will know what broke something since your tests broke right after that commit. This makes everything easier to see. When you don't write unit tests, not only are you not sure if the code works, but you are wasting valuable time as your project grows debugging and making sure everything still works. An immense refactor could break one thing, but you would have to dig for hours finding what exactly broke and where. Although, it's easy to forget to build your project after you change something and commit it, or it takes a lot of time, which leads me to the following statement. Mistake 3: Solo programmers don't use continuous integration. Continuous Integration, \"CI\" for short, is basically a process where your project is built from your latest source code. Whenever you modify your repository, the CI system basically builds your project, runs tests, and makes sure everything is in order. People normally don't use this because it seems like overkill for a simple project. Your project is small and pretty much personal. You can test it all on your own system since you're the only one building your code. This is pretty naive. There are times where you forget to compile, or you don't have an IDE handy and don't see your mistakes right away. An immediate benefit from this is that it saves time. You don't have to manually wait to compile your code; as shown in this picture, compiling really takes out time from your programming and breaks your train of thought. Furthermore, it makes sure all builds are run in the same fashion, so that you know code will compile for everyone. Now, maybe 2 years ago, that wasn't really an option. You had to purchase a VPS and configure it with Jenkins or some other thing, etc. But now there's a really nice distributed build system, a FREE one, called Travis. It supports a number of languages, from Ruby to Java to Node to Groovy -- it's constantly getting more and more support for more and more languages. Travis also emails you when a build breaks and gets fixed, so I get a notification when I make a mistake in my code. But CI really isn't useful if you don't have a nice, automated build script. This brings me to... Mistake 4: Solo programmers don't use build automation. There are a whole lot of people I have seen who decide to commit their .project in Eclipse or their nbproject folder into source control, thinking that that's all they really need to have a well-made project. But the problem is, Eclipse users can't use Netbeans projects and Netbeans users vice-versa. People have to work to get other people's code working in their development environment. That's where build scripts come in. I am a huge fan of Apache Maven. It automatically downloads dependencies and builds your JAR in the way you want it. Best part, it's universal. I works in all ides and text editors. Everyone just has to type \"mvn clean install\". It's that simple. And by everyone, that includes your trusty friends Jenkins and Travis, too. By using build scripts, everyone can jump into your code right away. When alone, you can transfer code between computers easily. Furthermore, build scripts usually have other tools part of them, such as replacing variables within files such as version numbers. It really makes things a lot easier and consistent. Mistake 5: Programmers don't plan. They just code. While it's nice to be on a spree of ideas, you need to engineer your code before you write it. A few months back, I dropped a project because it was too much to maintain -- the code was all just too messy and unorganized. I had random classes left and right, all because I didn't plan the architecture. Good design is important. Personally, I use Google Docs to manage everything. It's a nice cloud based service that allows you to work on documents in real-time with others. A text file in a Git projects works too, but Google Docs is probably a better choice. Conclusion I think the reason many people don't follow these rules is because as an independent programmer, they think they're free to do whatever they want and handle everything on their own. The thing is, they're not. It's much, much better to follow the same practices as they're not called \"best practices\" for nothing. People should treat all of their projects as they do group projects -- carefully planned, well-made, etc. You shouldn't be programming in the dark. Commit your code when you write it and treat it as a quality project, not just a bunch of ideas whipped together into a bunch of code.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Programming","slug":"Programming","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Programming/"}],"tags":[]},{"title":"MySQL check difference in days","slug":"mysql-check-difference-in-days","date":"2012-02-07T08:32:50.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2012/02/07/mysql-check-difference-in-days/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2012/02/07/mysql-check-difference-in-days/","excerpt":"","text":"I've encountered this problem recently and here's how I figured it out: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pvp_kills WHERE death_killer='Camaroow' AND DATEDIFF(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), death_time) There is no period at the end of this blog post","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Programming","slug":"Programming","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Programming/"}],"tags":[{"name":"sql","slug":"sql","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/sql/"}]},{"title":"You know you're a geek when...","slug":"you-know-youre-a-geek-when","date":"2012-01-08T12:26:26.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2012/01/08/you-know-youre-a-geek-when/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2012/01/08/you-know-youre-a-geek-when/","excerpt":"","text":"You know you're a geek when...

Computers, after all, were just algorithms. But today, computers have become so powerful that it seems almost inevitable that computers will become creative. In the movies, we see AI building new robots and creating better programs. But is this all just science fiction? Could we make a computer act like a human brain, creative and all? First, we must affirm that brains are indeed computers. This can be proved with the following syllogism. The first premise is that a computer is defined as something that takes input and produces output. Input would be things like keyboards and microphones, and output would be sound and the monitor. The second premise is that the brain only takes input and produces output. This is true. Without any input our output, one can only operate on innate knowledge (which computers can have too, in the form of a had drive) and would not change its behavior. Therefore, from this, we can include that the brain is indeed a computer. Now, it may be undesirable to call your brain a computer since it reduces you to algorithms, but it can't be argued. Your free will is computed based on how your inputs or internal thoughts influence you. It is impossible to act out of character unless you are thinking about acting out of character which would make you act in character. God can't make another God equal to himself. Second, we must prove that the brain is creative. Newell, Shaw, and Simon describe four attributes of a creative solution: first, the answer is novel and useful (either for the individual or for society), second, the answer demands that we reject ideas we had previously accepted, third, the answer results from intense motivation and persistence, and fourth, the answer comes from clarifying a problem that was originally vague. For the first attribute, we can conclude that this blog post is useful for me and I came up with this answer myself. For the second, my blog post rejects ideas of the brain not being a computer. For the third, I am motivated to create this answer. Finally, for the fourth, this clarified the concept that the brain is a computer. Any one of these four tasks are creative, so even having only one of these from a solution would make a thing creative. The more solutions an entity is capable of producing, the more creative the entity is. The human brain is creative because it can produce at least one of these solutions; it can even produce all of them. So, now that we have these ideas affirmed, we can conclude the following: first, the brain is a computer. Second, the brain is creative. Therefore, computers can be creative.

When this vital authority is removed, another one must take its place in governing the body. George Orwell and William Golding both illustrate different outcomes of such a situation in their novels Animal Farm and Lord of the Flies respectively. In both stories, a stable government is replaced by a volatile, even hostile environment. These books share the same concept in that a new government can easily appear to be better than the former one, when in reality it could be much worse. In both stories, the former government is seen as absolutely necessary to take down, no matter what the cost. Mr. Jones of Animal Farm delegates many strenuous tasks to the animals of his farm including pulling carts, sowing, laying eggs, etc. but keeps the profit to himself. Naturally, the animals do not like being bossed around and therefore become very angry and designate Jones as an enemy to their welfare. The only thing on the animals’ minds is to overthrow the terrible leader of the farm, not thinking of what they would do with power in their own hands. In Lord of the Flies, Ralph gives the job of tending the fire going to some of Jack's hunters, only to become furious when they let it go out, missing a possible chance of rescue. The children only do what they find fun, making them rebel against Ralph's logical way of managing things. Because they dislike following their jobs assigned by Ralph, they blindly migrate to Jack’s side, advertised as the opposite of Ralph’s tribe -- fun. The desire for change, as shown here, blinds the intuition of people on who is right, causing them to rebel harshly against authority. Even when the leaders of both groups become as terrible or even more terrible than the previous leaders, the people still comply with the new standards. When Napoleon kills some supposed traitors, other animals question Napoleon but do not stop him from killing. Napoleon, showing off his attack squad of dogs, effectively stops opposition, controlling his subjects through fear. Because the animals are so afraid of Napoleon’s strength, they accept Napoleon’s beliefs. In Lord of the Flies, when Jack tortures Robert, Roger, unsure of if the torture was ethical, just goes along with it. Roger, along with many other children on the island, wants to fit in and obeys Jack out of a lack of a better option. The children despised the logical, rule-based society of Ralph and just went with the only other option, driven by a desire to have fun and play. Although a leader may seem attractive because they are different than the old leader, the new leader could be as bad as the former one. When the new government gradually becomes a violent, turbulent society, the citizens begin to follow the new government with the idea that the former society was worse. In Animal Farm, Napoleon often conjures outrageous rules, telling the animals to follow or Jones would come back; the animals of course comply. The vision of the past society is unclear, so the animals accept this new society, assuming their past government was worse. Despite what the new society would become, the animals just let their issues be and were glad to not have the old society. In Lord of the Flies, Piggy is killed after being crushed by an intentionally dropped boulder, and the members of Jack's society do not even question the murder. As innocent children, members of Jack’s tribe likely wonder if it were moral to kill enemies. Because the new society allows killing and promotes it, the children never speak up and just accept it to be part of the society. A new society of change appeals to the people -- even if the changes are worse -- because they automatically view a different society as a better society. These two stories illustrate well that a new society can often bring change that makes the society worse than what it started as. While it may seem attractive to get rid of the evils of a current government, a new, but more evil government may emerge. Change does not necessarily mean for the better. These books firmly illustrate the fact that a different society is not always a better society.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"School","slug":"School","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/School/"}],"tags":[{"name":"animal farm","slug":"animal-farm","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/animal-farm/"},{"name":"comparison","slug":"comparison","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/comparison/"},{"name":"golding","slug":"golding","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/golding/"},{"name":"homework","slug":"homework","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/homework/"},{"name":"lord of the flies","slug":"lord-of-the-flies","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/lord-of-the-flies/"},{"name":"orwell","slug":"orwell","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/orwell/"},{"name":"paper","slug":"paper","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/paper/"},{"name":"summary","slug":"summary","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/summary/"},{"name":"william","slug":"william","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/william/"},{"name":"willian","slug":"willian","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/willian/"}]},{"title":"The School of Athens: A Representation of the Renaissance in the Form of Art","slug":"the-school-of-athens-a-representation-of-the-renaissance-in-the-form-of-art","date":"2011-09-19T10:23:48.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2011/09/19/the-school-of-athens-a-representation-of-the-renaissance-in-the-form-of-art/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2011/09/19/the-school-of-athens-a-representation-of-the-renaissance-in-the-form-of-art/","excerpt":"The fresco “School of Athens” by the painter Raphael is regarded by many as one of the greatest masterpieces of art man has ever created.

It represents the spirit of the Renaissance in a thought-provoking way. The work reflects how humanism and the love of man has penetrated the Christ-loving Middle Ages and the separation between reason and faith, religion and science. First of all, one can be quick to note that unlike previous art, Christ is not depicted anywhere in the painting. Instead the focus is towards Aristotle and Plato debating in an almost church-like room, showing how the people of the Renaissance regarded the ancient pagan scholars very highly. Everyone surrounds Aristotle and Plato and is connected to them in a radial pattern with invisible rays extending from the center out, showing how Aristotle and Plato are the focus of the painting. The old philosophers teach the young and eager, representing how young people of the Renaissance were disciples of the old, a classical idea from antiquity. Also, one can easily see the Greek gods and general architecture that the painting contains. The gods not only represent what the people in the painting believe, but they also show how the people of the Renaissance cared about, almost worshipped, the Greek culture. They thought of the Greeks and Romans as having the greatest inventions and knowledge in history and thought that their monuments could never match those of antiquity. The architecture also exemplifies this – arches are used throughout the painting, lots of marble was characteristic of Roman times, and the setting of being in the School of Athens also shows this. Finally, we can see everyone’s desire to grow in knowledge. Alcibiades, for example, listens intently, although he is strong and does not seem like the type to be interested in it. He represents how everyone, not just scholars, desired knowledge and craved it. Many listen intently to Aristotle and Plato, for they are like a shining beacon of knowledge in a world of blindness. All in all, the painting reflects the desire for a return to antiquity and classicism; it glorifies the ancient learners of the past and shows how everyone, including Raphael, wanted to know them again. It shows how the people of the Renaissance had a longing and intense interest in the Greek and Roman cultures and how the ideas of the past are not to be forgotten. It represents the humanist philosophy that the ancient world loved so much in that it values the teachings of the past, as opposed to others who found history useless before. Raphael demonstrates through his art that people wished to go back to the old but great society of ancient times. We can see the painting today as a depiction of a great desire for knowledge.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"School","slug":"School","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/School/"}],"tags":[{"name":"School","slug":"School","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/School/"},{"name":"antiquity","slug":"antiquity","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/antiquity/"},{"name":"art","slug":"art","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/art/"},{"name":"athens","slug":"athens","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/athens/"},{"name":"greece","slug":"greece","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/greece/"},{"name":"renaissance","slug":"renaissance","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/renaissance/"},{"name":"represents","slug":"represents","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/represents/"},{"name":"school of athens","slug":"school-of-athens","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/school-of-athens/"},{"name":"spirit","slug":"spirit","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/spirit/"}]},{"title":"Pattern Postulate - The Singleton","slug":"pattern-postulate-the-singleto","date":"2011-09-06T10:35:08.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2011/09/06/pattern-postulate-the-singleto/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2011/09/06/pattern-postulate-the-singleto/","excerpt":"I decided to flip through a little book called \"Head First Design Patterns\" today.

I guess for people who don't understand something immediately, they'd have 50 pages to learn it... The design patterns in the book were kind of outdated and bulky, too. So I've decided to make an easy-to-read blog post series on design patterns. Welcome to the first post of Pattern Postulate! (I don't even know what a postulate is, but it sounds catchy) A singleton is an object that only has one instance of itself. Now you may be wondering, \"Why can't I just make a static class?\" The answer lies in the fact that static classes are messy for holding things like variables. They can't use the \"this\" keyword to reference themselves. They can be initialized, but multiple times. It's just kind of funky to refer to a set of methods as something other than an object. On the other hand, singletons are objects. They can be passed through methods, etc. and even be EXTENDED! Whoa. But they still only have one instance. It's part object, part static class, and all fun! (That's a pun on a saying from my Latin class) So anyways, to make a singleton, you have to write something like this: public class MySingleton { private static MySingleton instance = new MySingleton(); private MySingleton() { } public static MySingleton getInstance() { return instance; } } We initialize the singleton in a private, static variable and retrieve it through a public, static method. Thus we can easily get the only instance of MySingleton ever created and ever will be created through \"MySingleton.getInstance()\". We have an object that we can use as one, instead of an annoying static class. I'm in no way saying that this is always the correct thing to do. For a Math class, for example, you don't want to make a new Math object and do object.sin(). That's just weird. For util-style functions like that, you should be using static methods. You should also use static methods for factories that don't require any class parameters. (I'll cover factories soon) But for something like a database class that would hold something like a JDBC url or if you have a resource manager class that requires you to store a few Maps of resources, you'd want a singleton. And that's it! 4 paragraphs of information as opposed to 20 Head First pages.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Theory","slug":"Theory","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Theory/"}],"tags":[{"name":"design patterns","slug":"design-patterns","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/design-patterns/"},{"name":"pattern","slug":"pattern","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/pattern/"},{"name":"pattern postulate","slug":"pattern-postulate","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/pattern-postulate/"},{"name":"postulate","slug":"postulate","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/postulate/"},{"name":"singleton","slug":"singleton","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/singleton/"}]},{"title":"Project Euler Problem 5 in Python","slug":"project-euler-problem-5-in-python","date":"2011-08-26T10:42:17.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2011/08/26/project-euler-problem-5-in-python/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2011/08/26/project-euler-problem-5-in-python/","excerpt":"This one runs really fast.","text":"This one runs really fast. import time starttime = time.time() num = 0 number = 2520 while (True): i = 11 while (i","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Programming","slug":"Programming","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Programming/"},{"name":"Project Euler","slug":"Programming/Project-Euler","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Programming/Project-Euler/"},{"name":"Python","slug":"Programming/Project-Euler/Python","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Programming/Project-Euler/Python/"}],"tags":[{"name":"project euler","slug":"project-euler","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/project-euler/"},{"name":"python","slug":"python","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/python/"}]},{"title":"Project Euler Problem 4 in Python","slug":"project-euler-problem-4-in-python","date":"2011-08-25T02:17:45.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2011/08/24/project-euler-problem-4-in-python/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2011/08/24/project-euler-problem-4-in-python/","excerpt":"I've decided to take up Python as a hobby.

Most of the exercises were easy. They were just tedious. But for some reason, they refused to stick in my head. I then decided to follow some Bukkit plugin writing tutorial. It didn't make sense to me. I thought to myself: Player listener, block listener, what's a listener anyways? Confused and frustrated, I took the advice of people from #bukkit and went to GitHub to find a plugin that was similar to what I was trying to do. I then played with the code a bit and realized what these listeners were. When I didn't know something, I Googled it. Now I have a good understanding of Java and know how it works. Public, static, void -- they all make sense to me now. I wanted to learn Java; I got where I wanted to be from just coding from the beginning. You don't have to learn first to be able to do. I did the same with PHP back when I wrote plugins for PHP-Fusion -- and PHP was my first programming language. Now, since I need to learn C/C++, I'll be writing an iPhone app. The same could be applied to most things. Learn the rules of a video game by brute-forcing random buttons. Learn a language by translating and looking up words immediately. (I did that with Latin) The best way to learn something is not from a book, but from learning things as you need them.

But a lot of us tend to eat this up easily. How? 1. Video The number one killer of hard drive space is video. Most videos of about 10 minutes shot on a normal camera tend to be around 200MB to 1GB. If you have a folder where you store your videos in, delete those videos and back them up to Facebook video or YouTube. YouTube offers 720p video, which is more than enough. If you want it locally (although in this time you really don't need that) you should either get an external hard drive (this one is only 60 dollars for 500 GB and is from a very reliable company) or burn the videos onto some DVD's. (The Memorex 4.7Gb/16x DVD-R (50-Pack Spindle) is a great deal for only $9.99. That's about 5 cents per gigabyte!) 2. Photos With all of these 10.1 megapixel point-and-shoots coming out, photos are becoming larger than ever. My mom's new Nikon point-and-shoot makes 5 megabyte pictures. My dad's DSLR Nikon D90 comes out with 12 megabyte pictures. Easily one 1000-photo vacation can take up about 10GB. While not nearly as space-hogging as video, pictures do come out to be huge. Try the backup methods for the video posted above. 3. Temp folder (Windows only) Try to find your Temp folder and see how big it is. Just go to Run and type in \"%TEMP%\" (without the quotes). Then highlight everything and delete. It's that easy. It got rid of 900GB of crap on one of my computers. 4. Recycle Bin/Trash Empty it regularly! It takes up as much space as the files you trashed. What doesn't take up much space: Applications -- the biggest ones like WoW and Guild Wars take 10GB max. Unless you have an application full of video. Music -- 3000 songs amounts to about 20 GB. Avoid FLAC files -- they are about 40MB a piece! (10 times as large as normal audio) Conclusion Delete your unused files!

I was compelled to write this post because of a certain organization that has gotten on my nerves: the MLA. The MLA is basically an association that promotes uniform standards, and my English teacher and the rest of my school, city, and state follow it. With my OCD, I would normally tolerate it. But one thing about them bothers me a ton: Times New Roman. The institution requires all papers written in their format to use Times New Roman. All. All papers must use an ugly 80-year-old font. This font and Arial aggravate me a ton. Why? They just don't look good. Microsoft had attempted to make a change by switching over to Cambria and Calibri in 2006, but I don't believe we will see results until organizations like the MLA decide to change their fonts. Most graphics today don't use Arial or TNR. In books, Garamond is typically used. The Harry Potter series for example, uses this awesome font made in the 1500's. Segoe UI was on the front of a magazine cover a while back. Papyrus was used (such an overused font though!) on the Avatar logo. But I have never seen Times New Roman or Arial embraced on any sort of thing other than papers and stuff older than the 1980's. The fonts just look cheap and ugly. Organizations like Microsoft and Apple I applaud for their support in changing fonts. But things like OpenOffice, the W3C and Web 1.0, people who use Windows 98 (12 years is a long time in the computer world), the person who made SimSun's English font some sort of weird thing, and many more just aggravate me in addition to the MLA. I know this blog post is all over the place, but people really need to change their standard fonts.

With a few downloads and a bit of knowledge, this tutorial on offline web development is easy to follow. (Should be...) Step 1: Install a few things Netbeans - Choose whichever version you want. I went for the all-inclusive version because I develop in many languages, but you can just pick PHP for now. You can always add more later. XAMPP - You should be downloading a file ending in .dmg. To install, double-click on both files and drag-and-drop to your applications folder. Step 2: Start XAMPP Open up your Applications folder, click XAMPP, and click on the orange icon. A window should pop up. Start all of these services and enter your password. XAMPP should now be running. Step 3: Start Netbeans Navigate to Applications and open it up. Simple, eh? Step 4: Make a Project Open up Netbeans and click \"File &gt; New Project\" or \"Shift+Command+N\". Here, you will be given a prompt. Select the \"PHP\" category and on the right pane select \"PHP Application With Existing Sources\". Then select \"Next\". For the sources folder, navigate to your Applications folder and click on your XAMPP folder. Then select the \"htdocs\" folder. This will be where all of your files go. Type in any project name and press \"Next\". Make the Project URL \"http://localhost/\". (Without the quotes, of course.) Click \"Finish\". Step 5: Connect the MySQL Database Although we can make PHP scripts and all, we of course need a database. Navigate to the \"Services\" tab, right-click \"Databases\" and select \"Register MySQL Server\". (Sorry if the picture is a bit misleading...) The settings are correct; check \"Save Password\" and \"Finish\". Now you have awesome database access built in to your IDE! :o Conclusion Of course, while Netbeans is by far the BEST IDE OUT THERE for PHP in my opinion, you could opt for a different one like Dreamweaver. (yuck...) Netbeans is free and easy to handle. For an FTP client, try Filezilla. For a browser, Google Chrome. Both are fast and easy to use. Don't forget to drag your programs to the dock!","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"PHP","slug":"PHP","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/PHP/"},{"name":"Programming","slug":"PHP/Programming","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/PHP/Programming/"}],"tags":[{"name":"development","slug":"development","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/development/"},{"name":"ide","slug":"ide","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/ide/"},{"name":"integrated development environment","slug":"integrated-development-environment","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/integrated-development-environment/"},{"name":"offline","slug":"offline","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/offline/"},{"name":"php","slug":"php","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/php/"}]},{"title":"Laziness is the Key to Failure","slug":"laziness-is-the-key-to-failure","date":"2011-04-12T08:03:58.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2011/04/12/laziness-is-the-key-to-failure/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2011/04/12/laziness-is-the-key-to-failure/","excerpt":"I have to admit, I’ve been pretty lazy with this blog.\nI haven’t posted since last year, and my common excuse is homework overload.\nBecause of this, I haven’t had readers.

While this blog post may just be written to myself and only about 5 people will read it, it doesn’t matter. What does matter is that I will be changing my habits from this day on. Even if I have a Mac. I need to be like what I was back in March last year. So anyways, I will be starting a funky new project called OrestesFW. It will be a framework in which I build other sites off of. I hope to build a Quizlet clone to someday. I will get that framework up and running by the end of the summer. I will be blogging more often, once every two days at least. Anyways, to sum this up, laziness is the key to failure.

The answer is, essentially, to pay attention, study, and work hard. This answer is not sufficient for most people -- including me. In learning information, I have compiled a list of some very good ways to recall information. 1. Quizlet Quizlet is a little tool that lets you make flashcards and play games with them. But that's not all -- it boasts a very universal API which allows people to make their own inerfaces for Quizlet. With my iPhone, I am able to access my flashcards anywhere. A great app is called iReview Flashcards -- it's free, easy to use, and while glitchy, I can take my flashcards anywhere I want. But when using this, there is a specific way of studying that will allow you to retain the information better. Use short definitions/terms. Remembering two ten-word phrases and associating them with different definitions is much easier than one twenty-word phrase. Play the games. The test/learn mode isn't very visual and won't let you retain the information as easily as a more graphical method where you are timed and must race to get the answer. Be competitive. In trying to beat the others' scores, you are more likely to remember the correct answers. Say the terms out loud as you type them. The more ways you retain the information, the more ways your brain makes links between term and definition. 2. The Associative Method A few months ago, back when I thought school was too hard, I found a really good answer on Yahoo! Answers on study techniques. The answer was written by a psychology student. Here it is: Find a location that you know well, your house perhaps. Grab a pen and notepad and walk through it making note of large objects that you will remember the location of. Then make another list of all the things you want to remember. Now say that first thing on your first list is a grandfather clock and the first thing on your second list is that pigs like mud. Make a mental image of the grandfather clock covered with mud and with a pig dancing in front of it. Make sure it's a way out there mental image that you will remember. Do this for every piece of information on your list. When you need to recall the info image you're walking through your house. You see the grandfather clock and all of a sudden you have the mental image pop back into your head of the muddy, dancing pig. Voila, information recalled. Basically, associate objects with concepts. Adding on to this method, you may want to quiz yourself by just walking through your house, looking at your pens, etc. This method, however, is not the best for things like vocabulary quizzes. 3. Sleep-studying Record yourself going through your notes in the most exciting way possible. (with emotion!) Right when you are about to sleep, put some headphones on and lay in your bed, listening to your notes to go to sleep. Most likely, you will get through your notes once or twice. Make sure you were concentrating on the notes only, not how your day was etc. Whilst sleeping, your brain will store the information learned right before it easily. Furthermore, frequently the thoughts you have before sleeping become your dream. With this method, I've had dreams about meeting Greek philosophers, talking to a smart guy who knew a lot of words, being a soldier in Rome, etc. Before you sleep, use your imagination to create some sort of story in your mind that you will immerse in as you fall asleep. This method takes a lot of practice, but it works for even the hardest of tests. 4. Pay attention in class Listen actively, taking as many notes and highlighting as much as possible. This way you retain the information more easily and can associate the experience of learning with your information as you try to remember an answer. 5. Take a nap if you feel tired! Despite what they say -- do your homework before you nap -- that is not exactly the best idea. Napping does not store information as well as a full rest does. For me, it's better to take a 5-hour nap and stay up until 12 studying than it is to study, nap, eat dinner, then play a video game or watch TV before sleeping. Remember, what you learn before you sleep is what you remember the next day. Also, make sure you study everything before sleeping. You know how you practice piano one day and can't figure it out, then the next day, you're a virtuoso? Similar concept. 6. Take mental breaks Studying for extended periods of time can be stressful and will cause you to become bored. Taking a mental break from studying by going off to play a video game, watching TV, etc. will actually be beneficial. Just make sure you keep your train of thought in your memory. When you are studying, study and ONLY study. 7. Take notes. Not just any old notes... but Google Docs notes! First, your thumbs don't hurt (unless you are a horrible typer), second you can study with other people aided with Skype, and third, you can save and print these documents. You can turn these into audio with a Kindle or something, etc. Google Docs has always worked for me. Retype your written notes and digitize them! Be your own Project Gutenberg! If you follow these 7 steps... I guarantee, studying will be much more productive! Any questions, adulations, concerns, burnt offerings? Please leave them as a comment below. I'd appreciate your techniques/comments.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Life Hacks","slug":"Life-Hacks","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Life-Hacks/"}],"tags":[{"name":"how to study","slug":"how-to-study","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/how-to-study/"},{"name":"how to study effectively","slug":"how-to-study-effectively","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/how-to-study-effectively/"},{"name":"i cant study","slug":"i-cant-study","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/i-cant-study/"},{"name":"study","slug":"study","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/study/"}]},{"title":"Achilles’ Sacrifices in The Iliad","slug":"achilles-sacrifices-in-the-iliad","date":"2010-12-13T10:30:54.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2010/12/13/achilles-sacrifices-in-the-iliad/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2010/12/13/achilles-sacrifices-in-the-iliad/","excerpt":"[caption id=\"attachment_804\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"240\" caption=\"An Interpretation of Achilles&#39; Shield\"][/caption]\nTraditionally, all great heroes have sacrificed one thing or another.

The Greeks, being a very anthropocentric people who worshipped the power and ability of humans, created many great works of literature of heroism, Homer being one of these great writers. In his epic poem, The Iliad, Homer writes of many great heroes and warriors who would sacrifice everything to achieve kleos, immortal glory. One of these ideal, perfect characters is Achilles, a strong, ideal male warrior who seeks to do acts of justice. Achilles sacrifices much of his former personality characterized by arrogance and becomes a new person as a whole in order to fulfill the after-death wishes of his most cherished friend, Patroclus. Near the beginning of The Iliad, after Achilles had been wronged by Agamemnon, Achilles has a deep-rooted antipathy towards Agamemnon and refuses to participate in battle despite the fact that the Greeks may suffer defeat without him. Despite being offered a load of gifts by “the shameless bastard,” Agamemnon, before the death of Patroclus, Achilles declines Agamemnon's gifts, implying that “they mean nothing” to him (Homer 140). As a result of the previous and still imminent avidity of Agamemnon, Achilles surmises he must repudiate this offer in order to retain his pride. With the gifts being the sole motive and having a myriad of reasons not to fight, Achilles refuses Agamemnon’s generous but egocentric proposal. Before the death of his dearest companion Patroclus, Achilles already recognizes his choice between either having his “glory” to be “undying forever” by fighting or to return “home” to his “dear fatherland” of Phthia (Homer 141). When confronted with the decision of not only whether to accept Agamemnon's gifts or not but also to choose glory or life, Achilles chooses to live as opposed to having glory because the death of Patroclus had not happened yet. It would only be when Achilles chooses life that his emotional and more circumspect side is revealed. Without the death of Patroclus, Achilles does not sacrifice anything for anyone and instead fumes at Agamemnon and acts selfishly. In order to avenge the death of his dear friend Patroclus, Achilles swallows his pride. Upon hearing of the news of the loss of his “dearest friend of all,” Achilles claims he “killed” Patroclus (Homer 160). By pronouncing that he “killed” Patroclus, Achilles blames himself instead of Hector for the mishap and dishonors himself in doing so. Achilles, instead of accusing others and maintaining his respectable reputation as usual, denigrates himself. Wishing that his mother had not “married a mortal” and had not given birth to him, Achilles desires to “die now” and “no longer” possesses “the will to remain alive” (Homer 160, 161). By stating he does not want to “remain alive” anymore, Achilles reveals he does not have personal worth. Achilles no longer has self-respect but the complete opposite: outright humility. Although the “warlord Agamemnon” had “angered” him, Achilles decides to “let [Agamemnon's wrongdoings to himself] be, no matter how it hurts” and will “conquer” his “pride” (Homer 161). By giving in to Agamemnon “no matter how much it hurts,” Achilles decides to endure the abasement he will receive. In deciding to accept Agamemnon's gifts, Achilles relinquishes his dignity by releasing his grudges against the king and in illustrating that he is not above Agamemnon. Instead of saving face, Achilles chooses to endure his shame and seeks redemption for the death of Patroclus. Despite the demanding nature of the king of Troy, Achilles shows respect and courtesy towards Priam, surrendering his hatred and contempt towards Hector to carry out the will of Patroclus. When he proclaims to Priam that his “son is released,” Achilles calls Priam “sir” and serves him “supper” (Homer 201). In doing this act of respect, Achilles is shown to revere the guest-host relationship between Priam and himself greatly, even using the honorific of “sir” and treating an enemy to dinner in order to be polite. Because Achilles is to respect Hector and to bury him, Achilles does not mistreat Priam. Despite Priam's imperative and somewhat rude dialogue of “show me to my bed now... quickly”, “let flaming wine pass down my throat”, and other instances, Achilles obeys Priam (Homer 202). Even though he is in a more powerful position, Achilles follows Priam's mandates without question, showing his reverence for the old man. This respect is rooted in Patroclus' message, further showing Achilles' sacrifice of his feelings towards Hector for the sake of his dead friend's will. Finally, Achilles consents to Priam's “armistice” – “to bury” his “Hector” for him (Homer 202). Compared to Priam's kissing of Achilles hand, this action is relatively insignificant as compared to the armstice in which Priam commissions Achilles to do, therefore the action was for a deeper reason – the realization of Patroclus’ wishes. After receiving the vision from Patroclus about Patroclus' real desire after death, Achilles realizes that the solution to avenging Patroclus' death was not by channeling his menis into the hating of Hector, but to bury Hector and have philotes towards Priam. By honoring Priam and sacrificing his deep emotions of hatred, Achilles carries out his dead friend’s wishes despite him not favoring the idea. With the extreme motivation caused by Patroclus behind his back, Achilles sacrifices his entire personality for his dead friend, causing the tables to turn in the war and the peaceful mind of Priam. By renouncing his pride and recanting his ill feelings towards the warrior who had killed his best friend, Achilles fulfills the wishes of many and learns to have respect. Achilles, realizing that fate cannot be changed, chooses to fight and die instead of a less honorable death. In order to be a hero, some sort of sacrifice must take place, whether it be some money, a cherished belonging, or even life itself.

Obviously, you have, since you are reading this page. But back to the point -- I've come up with an ingenious way to see the codes of Coke bottles WITHOUT having to buy (or open) the bottles themselves. Supplies needed: Bright LED light / iPhone 4 Voice Recorder/Notepad/iPhone 4 Mirror (optional, may even make things more difficult) Step 1: Find a 2-liter bottle of dark cola Dark cola refers to either Coca-cola, Diet-coke, or whatever they sell these days that is dark. It is crucial that the cola is dark, for if you use something such as Sprite, you will not be able to use my method. Place the bottle in a spot where you can view the top easily. (Make sure the shop managers can't see you in the middle of a crowded aisle too -- don't get caught!) Step 2: Turn on your LED light This is crucial in being able to view the code. The light should be bright and inconspicuous. I have a good one below. Streamlight Nano Light Miniature Keychain LED Flashlight I personally use my own iPhone 4 and use a free app called LED Strobe, but you can do whatever you want. Step 3: Touch the LED to the top of the cap The LED should be right on the cap, allowing as much light as possible to shine through the cap into the bottle. Step 4: Look at the reflection The underside of the cap should reflect into the cola. Find a good vantage point in which you are able to view the reflection of the cap in the cola. Make sure the cola is as still as possible. The letters will of course be mirrored, so make sure you're reading in the right direction! (To figure out what direction you're looking at the text in, look at a letter that is easy to see the direction of, for example, R. If the \"R\" looks like \"Я\", read right to left, up to down. If the \"R\" looks like \"ʁ\", read left to right and down to up. You can do the same for various other letters. Step 5: Record the code To record the codes, I usually go down a row and recite the codes into the voice memo app for iPhone. You could also write down the codes, record them into your own voice recorder, or whatever. Tips Line the Coke bottles up in a row. It'll make it easier to record multiple codes. Go to a less-crowded aisle. I went to the bargain-deals aisle to record the codes.

In the middle of the reformat of \"DATAFORTRESS II\", I decided to stop since it had already been 4 hours. Next thing I know, access is denied to my hard drive. Reformatting the corrupted hard drive didn't work. I still got the error of \"drive does not have a recognizable file system\" and \"do you want to reformat it?\" Yes, I would LOVE to reformat it, except the reformat isn't working! Angry, I tried one last thing -- I went to the Disk Management utility. (Right-click My Computer, click Manage, find Disk Management under the Storage category.) The drive was showing the size of itself, its partitions, etc. To fix my hard drive I removed the drive letter by right-clicking on it, deleted the current partition by right-clicking it in the bottom pane, and clicked \"Delete Volume\" and created a new volume called \"DATAFORTRESS II\" -- you can name it to whatever you want. Now I'm happy and safe with the 150GB of files I needed to store and a vault for future computer backups. The files on it were of course backed up as I was planning to reformat sometime soon, luckily. If you cannot format your external hard drive, this technique should work 99.99% of the time. Unfortunately, you'll lose all your data, but it's worth saving the money of buying a new drive where you will have lost the data anyway. From this experience I have learned that the only fully reliable storage media is solid, unchangeable, and not influenced by magnets -- things like CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs which from now on will be where my important files will be backed up onto.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Computer","slug":"Computer","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Computer/"},{"name":"Hardware","slug":"Computer/Hardware","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Computer/Hardware/"},{"name":"Tech","slug":"Computer/Hardware/Tech","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Computer/Hardware/Tech/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hardware","slug":"Hardware","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/Hardware/"},{"name":"corrupted","slug":"corrupted","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/corrupted/"},{"name":"hard drive","slug":"hard-drive","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/hard-drive/"}]},{"title":"iPhone 4 announced at 2010 Apple WWDC","slug":"iphone-4-announced-at-2010-apple-wwdc","date":"2010-06-08T12:33:48.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2010/06/08/iphone-4-announced-at-2010-apple-wwdc/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2010/06/08/iphone-4-announced-at-2010-apple-wwdc/","excerpt":"On June 7th, 2010, Apple revealed its brand-new iPhone at its annual worldwide developer conference.

Looks familiar, right? It was the same iPhone picked up a few months ago by Gizmodo -- only this time, it's real, confirmed, and tested. Style First off, the new iPhone is very stylish. Many are bashing it's rather angular look, but it's actually not that bad. The phone is 0.11 inches thinner than the 0.48-inch iPhone 3Gs being at an anorexic 0.37 inches, so those of you with tight pockets will really appreciate it. The phone is also narrower -- 2.31 versus 2.44 inches. The weight of 4.8 ounces remains constant, but the size difference makes the iPhone 3Gs look like a bag phone. (not really, but you get the point.) After holding this sleek gadget, rounded corners may not as great of an enhancement at all. The volume buttons are now separated, which I don't really find too attractive. The face and back are covered in an oil-resistant glass, according to Apple. The aluminum edging doubles as the device's three antennas. Display Thanks to the Retina display, everything you see and do on iPhone 4 looks amazing. Text in books, web pages, and email is crisp at any size. Images in movies and photos are stunning at almost any angle. That’s because the Retina display’s pixel density is so high, your eye is unable to distinguish individual pixels. The new \"Retina\" display -- named for having more pixels than the human eye can see -- packs 960 by 640 pixels into the screen -- that's four times the 3Gs and the highest on the market. These 326 pixels per inch were specially developed by Apple to be 78 micrometers each. The display uses a technique called IPS to provide a higher viewing angle than the 3Gs -- the same technology used on the iPad. The phone has an 800:1 contrast ratio. Sounds like the difference between a DVD and a Blu-ray disc. Same information, major difference. Multitasking Now you can run your favorite third-party apps — and switch between them instantly — without slowing down the performance of the foreground app or draining the battery unnecessarily.* This smarter approach to multitasking is available only on iPhone. Finally, the critics are defeated with this new enhancement. The Home button now leads to creates a little menu at the bottom of the screen while you're in an app. It shrinks your current screen and lets you select an app from that menu. You then switch to that app and your old app's session is stored, letting you go back to the app as you left it. For easier navigation, there are app folders, too. You can also listen to audio from an app -- Pandora users, meet heaven. You don't have to stay in the app to listen to it, in other words. VoIP is also possible while using other apps. For Skype, you can call and go to your email at the same time -- just like normal calling. Apps can also be run in the background when doing something like uploading a picture -- no more waiting around for your Facebook photo with slow wireless. Additionally, push notifications are still here. 5-Megapixel Camera with Flash Never miss a photo opportunity. The 5-megapixel camera built into iPhone 4 captures amazingly detailed images. A built-in LED flash illuminates low-light scenes. And the 5x digital zoom gets you closer to the action. You can even shoot self-portraits with the front camera. Finally, take those pictures in the dark with faster shutter speeds! With 5x digital zoom and 5 megapixels, this camera is almost as good as a point-and-shoot. Even better, you can take pictures of yourself for whatever reason.You can also focus by tapping on what you'd like to focus on instead of auto-focus. Plant in your way? Put it out of focus! Other cool stuff Video calling is possible with FaceTime -- with both cameras. A top microphone is built into the new iPhone for noise-cancellation for better phone calls. iBooks will let you catch up on your favorite novels. Edit videos with iMovie. There's one e-mail inbox for easier browsing. There's just so much to love about this new iPhone. A common misconception: there will be no 4G in this phone. First of all, AT&amp;T doesn't even have a network to handle it. To get or not to get... The new iPhone 4 will start from $199, the same price as where the old iPhone 3Gs started just the day before, with that 3Gs going down to $99 and the 3G being wiped off the market. Most likely, I'm preordering it, as I need a serious upgrade from my three-year-old hunk-of-junk first generation iPhone with a crappy case. On June 15, you'll be able to preorder from the official iPhone site. The party starts June 24 -- you don't want to be late. After all, there's going to be huge lines, so I recommend the preorder greatly if you're sure of purchasing this great hunk of metal.

True -- in late January the Youtube page was redesigned again. Today, April 28, Youtube unveiled its newest video player, taking a more streamlined approach to viewing videos. The player makes many aesthetic changes to the current player. The bottom \"seek\" bar is moved above the controls and can be hidden when the mouse is moved off of the video player. Volume changing is available when mousing over the volume button, also doubling as a mute button. The little resolution changer looks much more sleek now. Colors are also much brighter. Less attention is wasted on the seek bar since it fades out after the mouse is removed. As you can see though, the bar takes up a little more space than the previous one. The problem with this new design is that the seek bar is hard to hide. While it only takes a few seconds to hide it after moving the mouse off of the small player, in full screen, the seek bar cannot be hidden and is placed ON TOP OF the content. The bar does look sleek, but I think the older, more compact design works better. Here's an example video (shown above) of the new player in action. (Not all videos have been upgraded yet.)

The other day, I was searching for \"PHP class add parameters\" and nothing came up. It was after reading about how to use PHP class constructors that I was actually able to do this. Constructors define how your class is created and can also have parameters. In essence, they make your classes modifiable. Constructors can be used for a variety of reasons. In my case, I needed it to connect to a database. Instead of using a function and a class, I combined my function into a constructor. For this reason, I will show you how to use a class to connect to a database as an example. Step 1: Create the __construct() function in your class I named my class icdb. You can, however, name it anything you want. class icdb { function __construct() { } } Step 2: Add parameters to the __construct() function Add parameters to this like any other function. function __construct($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass, $db_name) { } Step 3: Make your function Do whatever you want. Here I am connecting to a database, obviously. function __construct($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass, $db_name) { global $db_prefix; $link = mysql_connect($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass); $db = mysql_select_db($db_name); $this-&gt;prefix = $db_prefix; return $link; } Step 4: Add legacy support for PHP4 PHP 4 handles constructors differently. You must create a function with the name of your class within your class. Here, I must make the function icdb(). function icdb() { $this-&gt;__construct(); } Final Code You're now done! Here's all of the code put together. class icdb { function icdb() { $this-&gt;__construct(); } function __construct($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass, $db_name) { global $db_prefix; $link = mysql_connect($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass); $db = mysql_select_db($db_name); $this-&gt;prefix = $db_prefix; return $link; } } And to initialize the class: $icdb = new icdb(\"localhost\", \"myUser\", \"myPass\", \"myDb\"); And that's it! You are now connected to a database. Now all you need is to add functions to the class to work with the database! You can use this method to add parameters to any PHP class.

In some areas, people kiss the hand to seal the deal. It is also possible for the swear to go three ways, as shown on the right. Traditionally, the swear is considered the highest promise of all promises and the pinky wuld have to be severed if the promise was broken. In modern times, this is much more informal and common among school-age children and close friends. The pinky swear cannot be broken or countered by crossing of the fingers, either. It can only be broken if all parties agree or the majority agree to break it. So, the origin? For all you manga lovers out there, this most likely comes from Japan. In anime, this is called a yubikiri (指切), Japanese for \"Finger Cut-off\". (For those of you who know of hara-kiri, that also involves cutting. See the similarities?)

She has started and is leading a movement that has inspired many and has already fed 120,000 people who cannot afford a decent meal. Phoebe started this massive project when she was five years old while on the way to school. She saw homeless people on the street holding up signs asking for food, money, etc. When she asked her mother why people live that way on the street, her mother replied that they don’t have jobs, bad things had happened to them, etc. Since their family collected cans at home to turn them into cash, she asked why they couldn’t do that for the food bank. The mother, of course, was skeptical in a five-year-old’s abilities and expected to collect $700 maximum, but she let Phoebe pursue this. [caption id=\"attachment_651\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"360\" caption=\"A letter written by Phoebe herself\"][/caption] Phoebe then wrote letters out to different people – during free time, she would hand-write, sign, and send letters to family and friends. She had the goal of collecting $1,000. You may think this goal was ambitious and nearly, if not impossible, for a five-year-old. Despite these age barriers and such, Phoebe managed to collect $3,736.30 within two months, almost four times the original goal and enough to feed about 18,000 people. A video was then posted on GoInspireGo.com and it immediately went viral. Six months later, Gayle Keck, a Media Manager for the San Francisco Food Bank, announced the total for the entire project to be $20,202, enough to feed about 90,000 people! The video posted on GoInspireGo was later submitted to the Tyson Foods’ Hunger Relief Challenge. Phoebe then won this challenge as the “Tyson Hunger All-Star” which comes with a donation of 15 tons of chicken – enough to feed about 120,000 people! Phoebe has shown me and thousands of others that age doesn’t matter when doing acts of kindness. Every action is like a quarter – no matter what state is on it or who gives it to you, it’s always worth 25 cents. Being rich or famous doesn’t really matter much either – the only difference is that the rich can donate much more money. The thing that matters is that people are kind and are willing to spend their time and efforts. Phoebe also shows the power of self-esteem. Many children are not ambitious because they believe they cannot do much. One movie I watched involved a man trying to get a scholarship at a prestigious college. Out of hard work, he eventually did earn the money (but lost it) and his story earned the scholarship. He believed that he could earn money by doing a risky deed (gambling) but eventually succeeded. As my third-grade teacher said, reach for the stars. If you believe you can do something, just do it. Phoebe may help inspire others to donate and ask others. Before reading this article, I would never think that I could actually get thousands and thousands of people to start doing something as simple as recycling cans. When we drank soda at a friend’s house, we threw the cans away. Imagine all of the other people in the world doing that. Before reading this, I wouldn’t have believed I could even get Frisco/Plano to give their cans to me. I’m not rich, famous, or old. Now I see that it’s possible to have a large influence regardless of age/status. If a six-year-old could do it, everyone else should be able to too.

For focusing this mounted or fixed lens on an extremely distant object, two aiming telescopes are set on the side of the lens barrel, and the entire lens is placed on a rigid stand which rotates smoothly. Minimizing the overall length had been a big problem in designing this lens. However, the Catadioptric system that is applied to the other two Canon mirror lenses (Canon 800mm f3.8 &amp; 2000mm f11) has succeeded in reducing it down to one third of the nominal focal length. In general focal length and optical aberration increase with each other, however, our long and persistent research and development have succeeded in solving this problem. Canon mirror lens 5200mm composed of spherical main and secondary mirrors and a correction lens would assure you of clear images. Here's a video of the massive lens in action. httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRq18WpQZC0 As you can see, it's so huge that it even needs a stand. You can see that the videos it takes are incredibly far away. That's not even the full range of the lens. According to the flyer, it can zoom in 18 - 32 miles away! Here's an advertisement from around the time it was made. [caption id=\"attachment_636\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"467\" caption=\"An Old Canon 5200 Advertisement\"][/caption] Now, let's think of practical applications. You're on a safari trip it the back of a pickup truck with this ginormous lens in your hands. Everyone around you thinks you look like you're in the turret of a Halo Warthog about to shoot some game. But you are about to shoot some game. Pictures of game. Haha! [caption id=\"attachment_635\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"515\" caption=\"Imagine these on the back or top of your car.

My political stance is neutral since I support who I think is best. Even so, I still don't like this universal healthcare plan. Why? Here are 5 of my stances. 1. Our nation's growing debt As of the end of 2009, our debt was approximately USD 12 trillion. (This even is rounding down more money than what Bill Gates and Warren Buffet hold combined.) Apparently, approximately $100 billion a year will be spent on this act. It is estimated we will get our money back by the end of 2020, but I don't believe this. Why? 2. More taxes imposed on higher-income people Obama proposed this a lot earlier, too, and this will up the taxes even more. People supported his belief in this because 1) the rich (Bernard Madoff) ruined the economy, 2) the poor are getting poorer, and 3) they were in that 95%. The problem is, the higher-income people also make our jobs, etc. If the higher-income people can't pay people to do their jobs, guess what? Outsourcing happens. Soon most jobs will be outsourced and... 3. We will lose our white-collar and middle-class jobs White-collar jobs involve the tech support, the programmers, the manufacturing plants (they're all in China anyways), the marketing analysts, etc. When these are gone, the people who worked hard to earn good degrees will go away. 4. The lowest 25% will lose their jobs The people who mow your lawn, clean your house, etc will lose their jobs out of middle-class frugality. Only the rich will afford it. 5. All our money is now outsourced It's all in the overseas people. The businesses will eventually move overseas out of lack of consumers and we'll all be on Obamacare. You know what, that doesn't sound too bad. Nobody has to work! XD Of course, this is very exaggerated. Most likely, the taxes on the rich will lose only a few jobs. At least everyone lives, right? But if taxes on higher-income people go up (which they will once Obamacare is long enough) we'll have barely enough jobs for the people of Colorado. So, what do you think?

Let me make this clear: Do not trust everything from Facebook friends! They could always have viruses that may be hard or easy to spot. Also, everything keyword-stuffed is traditionally spam. Anyways, back to my story... I was then redirected to a page about a \"funny video\".

Unfortunately, my updated version of McAfee didn't catch this program while I ran it with admin rights or downloaded it. Ayone else have this problem? The KoobFace worm's setup.exe does set up Koobface. It downloads the worm's variant according to where you were referred from, either by Facebook, Myspace, Bebo, etc., and puts it into your startup programs. It saves a copy of itself in a folder (mine was the System32 folder) and stays there. My .exe's name was bill103.exe, but it varies between many other names. The virus then impersonates things. On my computer, it went ahead and gave me some rogue security software. On other computers, though, it is known to steal data and solve CAPTCHAs. It then hijacks your computer and uses it as a web server to help spread the virus, a.k.a. a BotNet. (That's where you get the weird ip addresses.) It's funny how this thing can turn into a web server on the first try but Apache cannot even do that 100% of the time... If you want to see a sample page of Koobface, visit this Koobface Example Page (real deal). If you want to know where to download this virus, I have it right here.

A light-year is about 2.387 billion times the distance from Los Angeles to New York (in a straight line, of course). Imagine now 5 billion light-years. That's the approximate diameter of the entire universe. As you can see, even the Earth isn't big -- less than a tenth of a second if light traveled around its circumference. Stars, on the other hand, are huge. The Sun, a relatively small star, could hold around 1.3 million Earths. That's a LOT. Betelgeuse, a red giant star about 640 light-years from Earth, is about 1,000 suns across. That's one of the biggest stars we know. Since it's that close, we can expect many more stars like that. Enough talk. The universe is huge. If you saw the part where they zoomed out of the Milky Way, you can see how insignificant the Milky Way is to the rest of the galaxy.

But one cannot even comprehend the unthinkable superhero -- one that is not even a superhero in most minds: the GREENISH XENOLITH. What is a greenish xenolith, you ask? Let me quote Austin's almost exact words. (In the background) Let's get this over with already... (Stands) My hero is called a greenish xenolith. When a good guy steps on it, it teleports them. When a bad guy steps on it, it blows them up. The stem is \"xeno\" and it means stranger. (talking to himself) That was ridiculous. What did I say? It's a tool! The greenish xenolith is a strange type of superhero. Why? It cannot move on its own. It cannot think for itself. It can only tell good from bad. How is that a superhero? According to Austin, because it kills bad guys, it's a superhero. By definition, a superhero is \"a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers; also : an exceptionally skillful or successful person\" according to Merriam-Webster. Does this fall into that category? Well let's see. A fictional hero... Yes, it's completely made up, and it is a hero because it saves good guys from bad guys. ...having extraordinary or superhuman powers. Teleporting is superhuman, even though the greenish xenolith ISN'T human. And a hero is: A mythological or legendary figure often of divine descent endowed with great strength or ability. It is a figure, technically. Yes it does have great ability. So, it fits the definitions. Although it isn't what the public perceives as a \"superhero\", it still is one. Heroes do not always have to be human; they just have to do good things. Here's a real-life picture of a greenish xenolith: [caption id=\"attachment_573\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"512\" caption=\"Austin&#39;s Greenish Xenolith\"][/caption] I'll post more about it eventually, once I can get a hold of the greenish xenolith comic.

Rogue Security Software [caption id=\"attachment_561\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"614\" caption=\"Hey look -- Microsoft is selling a software that claims Microsoft is bad!\"][/caption] Rouge security software is basically antivirus software that posts fake warning messages. A great example of this would be Spyware Protect 2009 -- it claims to be made by Microsoft but in reality is made by hackers. They sell the software for $50. According to one source, one affiliate earned over $150,000 per week by selling and promoting this fake software. 2.

Nigerian E-mail Scams (419 Email Scam) Mostly everyone who gets spammed gets some of these Nigerian E-mail Scams. Heck, they even have t-shirts about this common scam. The scam, after all, has been going around for at least 10 years. The scam is called the Nigerian 419 email scam. Typically they're written in all CAPS, but in some cases, such as this one, they use upper/lowercase. These scams usually consist of paying money in advance to \"fund a transaction\" to your account. They let you pay the fee to get $10 million (or something similar to that amount) but in reality, they're just ripping you off and not paying you. They then proceed to take all of that money and run off living happy lives. Here is an example of one of these email scams. Dear friend.

The Los Angeles Tribune [caption id=\"attachment_558\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"602\" caption=\"Doesn&#39;t look suspicious at all, right?\"][/caption] Since this \"Los Angeles Tribune\" looked so legit (what with the nice urls and links to other news articles) I decided to read up on this blog post. It talked about a woman named Mary Steadman who decided to work from home using Google. Because of Google, she now makes $5500/month. She used a service called \"Easy Google Profit\". It said it was featured on ABC, AOL, CNN, etc., so I decided to click on the link. Whoa! EASY GOOGLE PROFIT?!?!?! Hmm... work at home for profit with just a computer and basic typing skills? Sounds like fun! [caption id=\"attachment_559\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"573\" caption=\"3 Easy steps? THIS CHEAP?!?!?\"][/caption] It's a risk free method! Featured on legit websites! Sounds great! Make up to $200-$943 PER DAY!!! But wait -- the terms and conditions! You have also subscribed to a fifteen-day trial to Grant Spring for just $24.87 a month and every month thereaftershould you chose not to cancel. Prior charges for all programs are non-refundable but bonus subscriptions can be cancelled and future charges stopped at any time by calling toll free 888-247-2155. If you choose to sign up for this product and pay the recurring monthly charges using a debit card you hereby provide pre-authorization and consent that blazingkeywords.com may charge $77.82 on a monthly basis. You may stop payment on any pre-authorized charge by notifying blazingkeywords.com at least three business days prior to the scheduled charge date. You agree your pre-authorization and written consent to charge your debit card is given in electronic form by submitting the request for the membership, and that an electronic signature is sufficient to authenticate your authorization to charge the debit card. You further agree that these terms and conditions shall be your copy of your pre-authorization for the debit card. Aww man... they're ripping us off... So basically, they say it's $1 to buy the kit, but you have to pay for all this extra stuff? Plus, you're using Google AdWords to do all of this, so you could have learned everything for free? I'm guessing this scam was made to promote slow businesses like Grant Spring and blazingkeywords.com... but this is one bad scam! Impersonation, etc... I'm surprised they're not in jail!","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Internet","slug":"Internet","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Internet/"},{"name":"The Dark Side","slug":"Internet/The-Dark-Side","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Internet/The-Dark-Side/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Internet","slug":"Internet","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/Internet/"},{"name":"fake lotto","slug":"fake-lotto","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/fake-lotto/"},{"name":"google","slug":"google","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/google/"},{"name":"google work from home","slug":"google-work-from-home","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/google-work-from-home/"},{"name":"list","slug":"list","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/list/"},{"name":"nigerian email scam","slug":"nigerian-email-scam","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/nigerian-email-scam/"},{"name":"rich","slug":"rich","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/rich/"},{"name":"rogue security software","slug":"rogue-security-software","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/rogue-security-software/"},{"name":"scammers","slug":"scammers","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/scammers/"},{"name":"software","slug":"software","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/software/"},{"name":"virus","slug":"virus","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/virus/"},{"name":"work from home","slug":"work-from-home","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/work-from-home/"}]},{"title":"Site Spotlight: Club Uber","slug":"site-spotlight-club-uber","date":"2010-03-05T08:22:38.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2010/03/05/site-spotlight-club-uber/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2010/03/05/site-spotlight-club-uber/","excerpt":"If you've been wondering I've been not posting for such a long time (almost a week) I've been doing much.

I had a few exams this week involving reading etc. But one of the biggest things I've been doing is reviving my old website, Club Uber. Club Uber was my first PHP-powered website designed in 2007-2008. Recently, though, I have been working on my latest website, D Critic. Therefore, Club Uber was abandoned. Now I am racing to get it to the status it was at before: active. The origins of Club Uber Back in 2007, I was working on making a website that my friends would actually like. My older websites were all pure CONTENT-- no games, no chatting, no nothing. Later I discovered that content could be dynamic using PHP. I used the Fantastico installer to install my first installation of PHP-Fusion. I looked to see REAL programming! HTML was like a second language to me at the time and I found it boring. After seeing what programming is, I decided to edit code. The programming language of PHP was relatively easy to understand. It was mostly in English. The code of PHP-Fusion was VERY poorly-written and very easy to understand unlike Wordpress. I eventually learned it over the summer of 2007. The first Club Uber featured a chatroom, messaging, and forums. Unfortunately, it was missing many big things that people wanted -- games. I did add games eventually and the site became a hit. At the height of its popularity, I would have had about 20 users logging in every day with 4 users staying on during the entire summer of 2008. My site was incredibly huge and quickly bypassed the 500,000 visits mark. Then I learned about WoW. I was addicted and stopped posting to the site. Eventually, the site expired in 2009 and all was lost. Today I present to you the Club Uber from the summer of 2008. I really hope you make this site a hit once again. Make it work. In a nutshell, what is Club Uber? Club Uber is a gaming paradise. Club Uber is a place to review things. Club Uber is a video sharing site. Club Uber is a virtual pet site. Club Uber is a forum. Club Uber is an instant messaging service. Club Uber is a search engine. Club Uber is an email service. Basically, Club Uber was built for the purpose of entertaining ALL audiences. It was the ONLY site you'll ever need and allowed everyone to have fun. The site lets you collect money which could be used around the whole site. Join today!

Have you at least ever heard someone say you lost The Game? After that, have you gotten mad at them and asked them what the game was? Then they talk about losing the game again and you are just plain confused? Here is what the game is. The Game's name is called \"The Game\". There are only three rules to the game. If you know what The Game is, you are playing the game. When you think of The Game, you lose The Game. Every time you Lose the Game, you must announce, \"I lost the game.\" In other words, you just lost The Game. This is probably the world's most infamous mind virus. Please feel free to infect your friends with this virus by either sharing this post or just simply telling them about it. I first heard about the game while at the SMU TAG program. Everyone was saying, \"I lost The Game\" in class in unison constantly, so after about a week, I asked a friend what The Game was. He replied that \"you don't want to know\". After nagging him for a few seconds about it, he finally told me the rules of The Game, shown above. I immediately announced my loss, he did, then I was in on this mind virus. According to one resource, the game was created in London. Nobody knows for sure, though. By the way, this is called \"ironic processing\" -- where you think about something by trying not to think about it. Here's the best resource on The Game: The Game Happy Gaming!

An interactive three-dimensional display system initiated by the SENSEable City Laboratory with ARES Lab. It plans to transform any ordinary space into a \"highly immersive and interactive display environment.\" It's basically a bunch of floating balls that are programmed to act together. httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnEN9B18v6Q From the video's page: Flyfire, a project initiated by the SENSEable City Laboratory in collaboration with ARES Lab (Aerospace Robotics and Embedded Systems Laboratory) aims to transform any ordinary space into a highly immersive and interactive display environment. In its first implementation, the Flyfire project sets out to explore the capabilities of this display system by using a large number of self-organizing micro helicopters. Each helicopter contains small LEDs and acts as a smart pixel. Through precisely controlled movements, the helicopters perform elaborate and synchronized motions and form an elastic display surface for any desired scenario. With the self-stabilizing and precise controlling technology from the ARES Lab, the motion of the pixels is adaptable in real time. The Flyfire canvas can transform itself from one shape to another or morph a two-dimensional photographic image into an articulated shape. The pixels are physically engaged in transitioning images from one state to another, which allows the Flyfire canvas to demonstrate a spatially animated viewing experience. Flyfire serves as an initial step to explore and imagine the possibilities of this free-form display: a swarm of pixels in a space. Cool, huh? We could use this for tons of things. You know in the sci-fi movies where there's a 3D Display that can move? Imagine that but on a larger scale. You know today's ads in New York? Why not put a giant ad 1000 feet in the air and have it fly? You know the movie theater? Why not make it in actual 3D? Graphs, teaching aids in lectures, and more can be achieved with this awesome new invention that's coming hopefully in the next 2 decades or so.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Internet","slug":"Internet","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Internet/"},{"name":"Tech","slug":"Internet/Tech","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Internet/Tech/"},{"name":"Youtube","slug":"Internet/Tech/Youtube","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Internet/Tech/Youtube/"}],"tags":[{"name":"3d","slug":"3d","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/3d/"},{"name":"display","slug":"display","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/display/"},{"name":"floating orbs","slug":"floating-orbs","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/floating-orbs/"},{"name":"flyfire","slug":"flyfire","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/flyfire/"},{"name":"flying","slug":"flying","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/flying/"},{"name":"monitor","slug":"monitor","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/monitor/"},{"name":"technology","slug":"technology","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/technology/"}]},{"title":"Mosquito-killing laser -- Phaser predecessor?","slug":"mosquito-killing-laser-phaser-predecessor","date":"2010-02-24T06:57:45.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2010/02/24/mosquito-killing-laser-phaser-predecessor/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2010/02/24/mosquito-killing-laser-phaser-predecessor/","excerpt":"A new mosquito-killing laser has been invented.

Windows 7 RC, the free version of Windows that was out there for about a month, is expiring! If you're like me, you have Windows 7 RC installed. If you're like me, you also can't find your Vista/XP installation disk! If you're like me, you \"forgot\" to partition your hard drive! If you're like me, you're freaking out like crazy trying to back up your files etc before doomsday and trying to make your computer usable again! To make it easier on you, here are 7 ways to use your computer after doomsday: March 1, 2010. Basically what will happen starting March 1, 2010 is that your computer will automatically shut down once every two hours. On June 1, 2010, your operating system will stop being genuine and continue restarting. The desktop will start black, according to this Microsoft article. So here comes the list: 1. Buy Windows 7 (and all your old software too) This is Microsoft's first recommendation; obviously they want to make money off of you. All your files, programs, and settings will go away. This is probably the best thing to do; make sure you SAVE all of your files and BACK THEM UP before doing this. (By the way, I did this.) 2. Find your Vista/XP installation disk This is what Microsoft recommends second to the first one. If you find it, when installed all of your old programs and settings will go bye-bye. Only do this if you don't want to buy Windows 7. 3. Buy (or build) a new computer This is a very obvious but great idea. I am doing this in addition to #1. If your computer is less that a year old, though, don't bother with this one. Try #1, #2, or #4 if your computer is new. Otherwise, go ahead with this. Note: If buying a new PC, I would choose Dell over HP. In my opinion Dell is more professional and is of higher quality. 4. Ubuntu/Linux Join the Open Source movement and be free. The thing is, Ubuntu is very different from Windows so it may feel very strange on a desktop like GNOME. Ubuntu does not have Microsoft Office, though. The upside to Ubuntu is that just about everything is free. Get OpenOffice.org and Firefox on this OS to replace your current interface. Even better, Ubuntu is faster than Windows. 5. Switch to a Mac Apple, although only around 10% of the computer market, is still a great competitor. Its software is intuitive and fast. I do not recommend Apple to anyone, but if you're one of those people who hate Windows, I encourage you to try a Macbook Pro or something similar. 6. Download RemoveWAT Windows 7 Activator (illegal) RemoveWAT Windows 7 Activator is highly not recommended. This is mostly about legal issues, though. It works on just about every version of Windows -- Beta, RC, x86, x64, etc. This was created by the great hacker \"Hazar\". No, I do not endorse it. Google it if you want it. I'm perfectly fine being legal. And no, I did not take that screenshot. 7. Download Windows 7 (illegal) Windows 7 is available on most BitTorrent websites since it is such a famous software. This also is not recommended at all by me. The same former friend downloaded the Windows 7 torrent and couldn't use his computer for TWO weeks. He finally did get Windows 7 RC back onto his computer and figured out how to get TimerNuke to work, but doing this is just plain wrong. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT do this. If you do, don't say I told you to. Note: Hazar's RemoveWAT is alleged to work with this too. Doomsday is coming soon. This is like the Y2K bug. Be prepared. Back up your files. Do what you think is right.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Computer","slug":"Computer","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Computer/"},{"name":"Microsoft","slug":"Computer/Microsoft","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Computer/Microsoft/"},{"name":"Tech","slug":"Computer/Microsoft/Tech","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Computer/Microsoft/Tech/"},{"name":"Windows","slug":"Computer/Microsoft/Tech/Windows","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Computer/Microsoft/Tech/Windows/"}],"tags":[{"name":"7","slug":"7","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/7/"},{"name":"Windows","slug":"Windows","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/Windows/"},{"name":"activation","slug":"activation","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/activation/"},{"name":"computer","slug":"computer","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/computer/"},{"name":"crack","slug":"crack","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/crack/"},{"name":"expire","slug":"expire","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/expire/"},{"name":"hazar","slug":"hazar","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/hazar/"},{"name":"linux","slug":"linux","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/linux/"},{"name":"list","slug":"list","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/list/"},{"name":"patch","slug":"patch","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/patch/"},{"name":"removewat","slug":"removewat","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/removewat/"},{"name":"software","slug":"software","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/software/"},{"name":"ubuntu","slug":"ubuntu","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/ubuntu/"},{"name":"windows 7","slug":"windows-7","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/windows-7/"},{"name":"windows 7 rc","slug":"windows-7-rc","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/windows-7-rc/"}]},{"title":"Breathing?

There's a page for that. Some are completely legit, such as a page for Facebook or a page for your city or even a page for your school district. But then comes the pages that clog up Facebook's servers: Breathing. Sleeping. Sleeping with one leg out of the covers. College-Ruled Paper. Not \"Becoming A Fan\" Of Everything. (Hypocrite!) Seriously, you know the people who become a fan of Facebook being too slow? The reason Facebook has gotten so slow is because of both AJAX, Javascript, and an overload of pages/groups! Sure someone may have a good reason to have a page, such as to promote a business or page, but this is a step too far. This is why Facebook is so slow, people. Pages like this use up all of the database memory and power. Even apps don't drag Facebook this slow; most requests and files come from other websites! Here's one I recently found which 20 of my friends are already fans of: Trying To Put On A T-shirt Without Messing Up Your Hair. Don't we all do that? If I'm not a fan of it, does that mean I don't care about my hair? Does that mean I'm a messy person? They even created an image for the purpose of this page. Another example is \"Questions on a test that give away the answers to other questions\". If I don't become a fan of this, does this mean that I don't like getting questions right? Does this mean that I like hard questions? Does this mean I want to fail class? Sooner or later, we all become fans of questions like this. Do we have to be fans? What is really annoying is those groups which ask you to invite all of your friends. Request spam, etc, is all over the place. The other day, I was invited to \"Texas, the bipolar state\" and \"February 11, 2010. The day it snowed 4 inches in Frisco.\" Seriously, page spam and random friending has to stop. These create nuisances all over the place -- on walls, in messages, requests, etc. If you really want to become a fan of sleeping, sleep instead of spamming us. I really think that Facebook should start approving pages.

But did you know that Mystery Google is going away for good? Why? Because of Mystery Missions! Mystery Seeker Mystery Missions is a site where users are able to post their own missions for others to do for the day, from texting someone to cheer them up on Valentine's Day to texting a Harry Potter spell to being a ninja for a day to brushing your teeth. (I know it may not sound all that great to some of you, but come on, doesn't everyone like ninjas?) Mystery Missions started out as a little site called Mystery Google. Basically, when you searched for something, you got what the previous person searched for. Later it became Mystery Seeker. Around this time, there was a little thing where you asked Mystery Seeker for a mission and they would give you one. This, though, replaces everything. Mystery Seeker is still up and running, but it is supposed to completely replace Mystery Missions in a short while. [/caption] Anyways, to get assigned a mission, you must go to the \"Headquarters\" screen and click \"Request\". Here you find a mission submitted by a user and can choose to either accept the mission or pass it up. Missions range from fun to boring and can involve just about anything. Some people create missions for their own gain, such as sending a text message. Some use missions to have people just do plain fun things, though. Here's a funny one: \"Google is anti unicorns found out why. Search 'unicorns w' and be surprised.\" The answers are surprising. To submit a mission, click the \"Submit\" button on the \"Headquarters\" page. Missions can be just about anything, as stated above. Just make sure you don't post emails or phone numbers without permission! A detailed list of all your current missions and submitted missions can be found on the \"Profile\" page. Mystery Missions also provides a custom-designed forum full of hundreds of active agents. Get to know your community there! Overall, Mystery Missions is a great site to just relax, have fun, and get laughs. This is one of those sites to go to when you get bored. The largest downside to this site is the (in my opinion) horrible interface, but other than that, it's very fun, engaging, and probably the most interactive site on the Internet.

[caption id=\"attachment_381\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"The iHome FastTrack Laser Mouse by LifeWorks\"][/caption] With its laser-mouse design, the iHome has worked on virtually any surface I have used. Although I use a mousepad, it has also worked on the actual desk, on a glass table, and hardwood. The sensor is highly sensitive at 1600 dpi, but I like to keep it at 800 dpi (there's a button to change the setting) since 1600 is very fast. (In other words, for those who need precision, this is a great mouse.) The mouse also glides very easily on most surfaces. It grips paper, though, so don't be putting papers under the mouse. As you can see, the design is highly ergonomic and fits nicely into your hand. My old mouse was a Targus Bluetooth mouse, and since it was a travel mouse, it didn't fit nicely at all and gave me many hand pains. Ever since using this mouse, though, I've gotten less hand pains. The thumb curves and fits nicely in the little groove on the left, and the pinky stays nice and cozy. I purchased my mouse at Ross (you know, dress for less) for $30 but you can also buy it at Amazon for less than $20. It's an amazingly great deal for a laser mouse; I was surprised at the quality when I first used it. Also, it's a plug-and-play mouse, so no driver softwares need to be installed. Buy it here: iHome FastTrack Laser Mouse (Red) As you can see, the design is very sleek and stylish. I'd highly recommend this mouse to anyone who wants a good, ergonomic wired mouse under $20.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Computer","slug":"Computer","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Computer/"},{"name":"Hardware","slug":"Computer/Hardware","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Computer/Hardware/"},{"name":"Reviews","slug":"Computer/Hardware/Reviews","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Computer/Hardware/Reviews/"},{"name":"Tech","slug":"Computer/Hardware/Reviews/Tech","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Computer/Hardware/Reviews/Tech/"}],"tags":[{"name":"accurate","slug":"accurate","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/accurate/"},{"name":"fasttrack","slug":"fasttrack","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/fasttrack/"},{"name":"ihome","slug":"ihome","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/ihome/"},{"name":"lifeworks","slug":"lifeworks","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/lifeworks/"},{"name":"mouse","slug":"mouse","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/mouse/"},{"name":"mouse review","slug":"mouse-review","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/mouse-review/"},{"name":"precise","slug":"precise","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/precise/"},{"name":"review","slug":"review","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/review/"}]},{"title":"A Personal Ad for the Count of Monte Cristo","slug":"a-personal-ad-for-the-count-of-monte-cristo","date":"2010-02-15T11:03:26.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2010/02/15/a-personal-ad-for-the-count-of-monte-cristo/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2010/02/15/a-personal-ad-for-the-count-of-monte-cristo/","excerpt":"If you haven't heard of the Count of Monte Cristo, it's a very twisted plot and love story.

The Count of Monte Cristo 28 Rue de la Fontaine, Auteuil, Paris, France Age: 33 years old My passion I am most passionate about doing what is right. Justice is something that I will always fight for. The selfish and envious should be punished for their wrongs against the righteous and humble. As the saying goes, “An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.” The top three things I am thankful for: Having enough wealth to be able to do what I please Good friends Being free of any prisons of any sort My friends describe me as: As noble as a Borghese Mysterious Empathetic What I look for in a partner I look for honesty and compassion. I also value beauty greatly, but a good character is much more important. My partner should be completely loyal to me and not cheat on me at all. An ideal date An ideal date for me would be a peaceful cruise alone in the Mediterranean Sea underneath a clear blue sky. We would sail to the Isle of Monte Cristo and talk there, far from other people. The first thing you will notice about me I am always dressed nicely and appropriately. When I talk, my voice seems very commanding and powerful to anyone I speak to. I seem very intelligent and knowledgeable about everything. I am very kind to kind people and not as kind to the rude. I help others in need when they are in distress unless they have not been nice to me. How I spend my leisure time I usually host or attend parties to socialize and learn more about others. When not at banquets, I try to learn as much as possible to seem better-rounded.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Random","slug":"Random","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Random/"},{"name":"School","slug":"Random/School","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Random/School/"}],"tags":[{"name":"count of monte cristo","slug":"count-of-monte-cristo","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/count-of-monte-cristo/"},{"name":"love","slug":"love","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/love/"},{"name":"personal ad","slug":"personal-ad","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/personal-ad/"}]},{"title":"The great spam experiment by Phil Bradley: How do we get spam?","slug":"the-great-spam-experiment-by-phil-bradley","date":"2010-02-14T06:34:44.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2010/02/14/the-great-spam-experiment-by-phil-bradley/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2010/02/14/the-great-spam-experiment-by-phil-bradley/","excerpt":"I thought this article was really cool; take a look at it.

Since I get so many spam emails every day, I decided that it was about time to look up where exactly spam comes from. Where do we get spam from? In common with about everyone else on the net I get spam emails flooding into my email box every day. In a dizzyingly short period of time I have the opportunity of achieving a larger penis along with enormous breasts, I can become a millionaire overnight, presumably the day after fixing my credit rating, I can take viagra to last longer with the woman that I hypnotised into bed, while watching nubile young ladies perform for me on webcam by paying them via the credit card that I've just been guaranteed. Spam is that amazing creation that allows all the crackpots, the fraudsters and the cheats to not only knock on our doors but to walk right in and make themselves at home. I've read a lot about how to stop spam - how to filter it out, how to report the people who do it, how to blacklist the people who send it to you, and how to track them down to real accounts - and all very interesting it is too. However, despite having spent some time looking around on the Web, I've not really seen anything that looks at how you actually get it in the first place. Yes, I know that spammers get your email address, which then gets added to lists and sold onto other disreputable people who fill your mailbox with junk, but I was interested in seeing how they got the email address in the first place. How widely spread would your address need to be in order to catch the attention of the spammers? As it turns out, not very widely spread at all, as we shall see. How I went looking for spam, and how spam found me I decided to create some email accounts, and then publicise this at various places on the web. I chose to use Hotmail for this purpose for a number of reasons - it was quick and easy to create accounts, Hotmail accounts are very common (who doesn't have one?), I could inspect them whenever and wherever I chose and it also meant that I wouldn't be getting any more spam than necessary in my own email box. I created a number of accounts that would be used for different purposes: A 'control' account that wouldn't be published anywhere I felt that this was important since I wanted to be able to discount any emails that had been sent out to addresses that had been created by a computer program. Consequently all my accounts were a variant on my name, with a numeric value after them. Any email that came into the control account could then be ignored in all the other accounts, since it had not originated from one of the accounts I was publicising. An account that was only publicised in the Hotmail directory and Internet White pages. I suspect that many people do not think to untag that option when they create an account, and I wanted to see if I got any spam as a result. Putting the address on a webpage, in an HTML mailto: link. I used my own website at http://www.philb.com/ for this purpose. Granted that it's not the largest site in the world, but I like to think that it gets enough visitors to warrant its use for that purpose, and the site is also to be found by in most of the search engine indexes as well. Posting to a mailing list I joined, and then posted to a Library and Information Science related mailing list (LIS-LINK) at JISCMail This isn't a particularly high volume list, but it does have its moments, and all the postings are publically archived for anyone to view. Posting to a newsgroup I registered another email account at Google groups and posted once there. I wasn't sure quite which group to post to, since I wanted to post to a fairly well known one, which had a lot of postings, but I also wanted to try and ensure that I didn't skew the results by posting to a group with a very specific interest; if I'd posted to a sex group for example I wouldn't have been sure if any pornographic spam was just being targetted at posters to that newsgroup. Eventually I played safe and posted to alt.test which as the name suggests, is for posting test messages. A pornographic organisation Obviously I knew that by requested pornography in my inbox, that was exactly what I was going to get. However, what really interested me here was to see if my address would be harvested as spam and sold onto other organisations who would use it for their own mailings. An opt-out list In my early days on the Internet I once emailed back somone who had sent something to a nonsense address at one of my accounts to tell them that 'niko.hk' wasn't to be found there, and to take that name off whatever list they had. From that day to this, I've received email for this rather strangely named individual, so I had my suspicions that this probably wasn't going to be a good idea. I chose one of the spam emails that I get in my normal account and visited the website address as suggested and input the address of my next email account. I was gratified to read that my name had been taken off their list and I wouldn't get any more mail from them - this was obviously going to be a quiet account! A Yahoo! group This final one was an afterthought, but a couple of people suggested to me that it might be a good idea, since they had received spam as a result of posting to various Yahoo! groups, so I duly created another account and joined a business related newsgroup and posted. I could have chosen many other places to publicise different addresses - there are plenty of other groups other than those provided by Yahoo! for example, and I also wasn't taking into account the spam that arises as a result of visiting particular websites. However, odd though it may seem, I do have a life and I wanted to make the most of the short summer months in England. Besides, I have clients who need work to be done for them, so I drew a halt at that point. Having set up the accounts, registered with the various services mentioned, and posted one single copy of each email address I then sat back and waited to see if my spam traps would work. I didn't have long to wait... Spam, spam, glorious spam! I had my first spam message inside a couple of hours, and it was to the email account I used to opt-out of mailings. To be honest, this wasn't exactly a surprise to me, and I was soon to discover opting out of a mailing list is like wandering into the rapids just wearing a small life protector - you're going to get swept along very quickly and end up drowning! Initially I was quite fascinated to see how much spam I was getting, and checked the accounts a couple of times a day, but after a while the thrill began to pall - after all it does get a bit depressing to realise that so many people think I've got a small penis and no money in my bank account! Eventually I ended up checking them once every couple of weeks, just to make sure that they were still active. I was also very wryly amused at how many of the spam emails assured me that I was only getting their messages because I'd visited their sites and requested to be kept informed about their various products - in fact once or twice I almost doubted myself and thought about checking to see if there was anything like sleep-computing! However, I was fairly convinced that even if I had been computing in my sleep I wouldn't be visiting sites about septic tanks, of which I seemed to get a lot of emails, entreating me to purchase one and improve my lifestyle. Quite how a septic tank is going to improve my lifestyle I'm none too sure - after all, 'Come up and see my septic tank' isn't exactly going to work wonders is it. Spam winners, spam losers Eventually however all good things must come to an end. Summer began to fade and autumn decided it was time to come out and romp and play, and I too decided that after about 10 weeks it was time to draw my spam experiment to an end. I was then faced with the enormity of going through each account in turn and adding up columns of figures. Rather than simply add up the number of emails I had received it had been suggested to me that it would be interesting to to classify them somehow. This appealed to me - after all, my background is that of a librarian, so a little bit of classification couldn't come amiss. It didn't take long to work out some major categories - I just had to look at the titles of the emails that I'd been sent. Regretfully I decided that I didn't have enough time to open each one in turn to read the contents - I would simply have to assign a category based either on the subject of the email or if that wasn't always clear, on the name of the sender, which usually was. Faced with an email with the subject 'come and see my website' wasn't necessarily very clear, but when it had been sent by 'SexySuzie' it didn't take too much working out! However, in cases where it really wasn't clear the email was assigned to the wonderful 'miscellaneous' category. The categories that I used were as follows: Financial Anything offering to repair my credit, make me a millionaire, find me a cheaper mortgage and so on went here Pornographic Fairly self explanatory I'd have thought. Health This was a slightly more difficult category, since many (most) of them related to sex in one form or another, but since they were not in and of themselves pornographic in nature I felt they should be elsewhere, and this seemed an appropriate place. Hardware/software related This covered everything from cell phones to virus checking software and all points in between. Attract a partner Several of these were related to hypnotising a woman into bed (though 'you're getting very sleepy' would seem to be a little self defeating, I would have thought), while others were about using scent, chat up lines and so on. Earn a degree Or a diploma. Or a Masters. Or a doctorate. Or... you get the idea. Holidays In the sun. Or the snow. Or in the far east, or anywhere at all apparently. Miscellaneous A complete lucky bag of the strange and downright wierd. Back to septic tanks again. Of course, I could have broken these categories down even further, but as I said earlier, I have a life. They're good enough for me, and if you don't like them you're more than welcome to try your own spam experiment. For those of you without a morbid interest in figures, the two outright 'winners' are money and sex. No big surprise there, but if you'd been expecting one I have to tell you that you don't know much about humankind. The actual breakdown is as follows: Financial 231 Pornographic 185 Health 108 Misc. 57 Hardware/ software 41 Attracting a partner 40 Getting a degree 40 Holidays 6 I was slightly surprised at the results, since I'd always assumed that I got more pornographic spam than anything else (who knows - maybe I do!) but clearly this wasn't the case here - financial spam came way out on top of the list. What I did find interesting was that I didn't get a single 'Nigerian letter' offering me a share of $50,000,000, yet I often get several of these a day in my usual email account. So quite where these come from (and don't say 'Nigeria') I have no clue at all. So where did the spam come from? At last I was in a position to find out. The weeks of waiting, tossing and turning in bed, and counting spam emails instead of sheep was coming to an end. Eagerly I added up my columns of figures, desperate to reach a conclusion. Alright - it's not amazingly exciting, but I'm doing my best, ok? Actually, it was rather surprising. Opt-out 350 LIS-LINK mailing list 244 Porn company 36 My website 26 Hotmail Directory 18 Newsgroup 17 Yahoo! group 0 Control account 0 By far and away the most spam came as a result of requesting not to receive anymore! This wasn’t actually that surprising, since I had a feeling that would be the case. However, the fact that a single posting to LIS-LINK resulted in 244 spam emails quite astonished me; almost 7 times the amount that I got from the pornographic site. (I should point out here that to be fair I discounted all the actual pornographic emails that I was sent, since I had in a way requested them – I just counted as spam anything that wasn’t pornography, ironically enough.) I was also surprised that my single posting to the Yahoo! group didn't result in any spam at all - perhaps I was just fortunate with the group that I chose. I’m not going to pretend that my experiment was particularly scientific, but then it wasn’t really intended to be. However, I think it was rigorous enough to draw some interesting conclusions from it. Firstly, under no circumstances should you respond to a spam email and ask to be taken off a list. While you may get taken off that specific list it’s quite clear that you’re going to be added to plenty of others! Secondly, and perhaps rather worryingly, it does appear (from a spam standpoint) to be a very bad idea to post to mailing lists; certainly not those that have publically available archives. I don’t image that a spammer has actually bothered to join the list, but I think it’s more than possible that they send software to crawl through the archives and collect email addresses which are then added to their lists. Consequently, the more that you post, the more likely it is that you’re going to get spam – and quite a lot of it! So who are the spam winners and losers? Well, that's a question that I can give a very quick and easy answer to; we're the losers. Anyone with an email address that is publically available on the Internet is almost certainly going to get spam at some point. Probably sooner rather than later I'm afraid to say. And the winners? Anyone who has managed to sell a septic tank across the Internet I should imagine! About Phil Bradley Phil has been an Internet consultant for 7 years and is widely known in the UK and abroad as a result of his teaching sessions, talks and the books and articles he has published about (and on) the Internet.

I don't mean the usual 1 inch of snow, but a freaking 4 inches! Amazing, right? But do you know what's even more amazing? My brother and I built a huge tower complete with a staircase! [caption id=\"attachment_333\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"262\" caption=\"Snow Tower of Doom!!!!\"][/caption] The tower was approximately 3 meters tall and made completely out of snow. It took 7 man-hours of development. What was the process in building this monster? First, we started way in the backyard (shown in the picture at the bottom-left) and rolled a huge snowball to make our base. (above picture) Then, we packed snow under it to keep it from rolling around. After that, we started to make a snowman. The snowman never really worked out, so we decided to build a tower. We did build the tower on the first day of snow, but overnight, the whole thing fell apart. Later, we decided to build a staircase out of snow since our dad wasn't helping us anymore because of his work. The staircase, I repeat, was made completely out of snow and each step could support my whole weight. We made the tower a little bit shorter than it is in the picture then went inside to eat lunch. Going back outside, we learned that the whole top half of the tower had been destroyed. I then alone rebuilt part of the tower and added two new steps to the staircase. After that, my brother came outside and started to hand me snow so I wouldn't have to keep going down and up over and over again. Eventually, though, my brother took a long 30 minute break so I built the rest of the tower to what is is now. (By the way, my brother was trying to climb up the steep front side of the sculpture and eventually succeeded.) After all the muddy work, we finally took a break, took our showers, and fell asleep. Today, it is still standing tall and proud. :) [caption id=\"attachment_340\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"The Snow Sculpture Today\"][/caption] [gallery]","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Life","slug":"Life","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Life/"}],"tags":[{"name":"frisco","slug":"frisco","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/frisco/"},{"name":"frisco snow","slug":"frisco-snow","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/frisco-snow/"},{"name":"frisco tx","slug":"frisco-tx","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/frisco-tx/"},{"name":"snow day","slug":"snow-day","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/snow-day/"},{"name":"snow in frisco","slug":"snow-in-frisco","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/snow-in-frisco/"},{"name":"snow sculpture","slug":"snow-sculpture","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/snow-sculpture/"},{"name":"snow tower","slug":"snow-tower","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/snow-tower/"},{"name":"tallest snow tower","slug":"tallest-snow-tower","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/tallest-snow-tower/"},{"name":"texas","slug":"texas","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/texas/"},{"name":"texas snow","slug":"texas-snow","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/texas-snow/"}]},{"title":"Pi Song -- Zoom! with a ? twist!","slug":"pi-song-zoom-with-a-%cf%80-twist","date":"2010-02-13T05:48:22.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2010/02/12/pi-song-zoom-with-a-%cf%80-twist/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2010/02/12/pi-song-zoom-with-a-%cf%80-twist/","excerpt":"You know, pi, right?

Do you visualize rows and alternating columns? Do you visualize the familiar QWERTY? Do you visualize the huge spacebar? Or do you see two orbs that you need to move around like an alien? Here's a list of 10 of the strangest, weirdest, and most unique keyboards. 10. The Maltron Single-Handed Keyboard Buy it on Amazon: Maltron Keyboards (Left Handed Version) (no right-handed on Amazon) [caption id=\"attachment_281\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\" caption=\"Maltron Left-handed Keyboard\"][/caption] This odd keyboard by Maltron is built for the less fortunate who only have 1 hand. In my honest opinion, it looks like it's from the 1990s where everyone used white plastic for their computers. On their website, they state that speeds of up to 85 words per minute have been recorded on their keyboards. This is actually not a bad keyboard; it just needs to get a contemporary upgade. For $650, this keyboard is a ripoff unless you really, really need it. 9. The abKey Revolution Site: abKey.biz abKey Revolution The creator of this \"revolutionary\" keyboard discovered the most common letters -- the vowels and R, S, and T -- by watching the Wheel of Fortune. Apparently, U, the 13th-most-common letter in the English language, gets a huge button for your left thumb. The A, Space, and Enter get similar enormous button treatment, while the letter \"E\" doesn't. Not so good now, huh? Get a load of this, though: abKey® has been shortlisted as a finalist for the Red Herring 100 Asia Award for 2006. The prestigious award recognises the most promising companies in all of Asia, highlighting those who have shaped the future of technology innovation and transformed markets. Nominees were evaluated on financials, management, and overall strategic integration into the marketplace. Really?!? Well, there are some good things about it. A great thing about it is the ergonomic \"V\" shape, which is the normal position supposedly. But the layout of the keys is just wack. They claim QWERTY is a curse; do some research on the Dvorak keyboard first! If you really want it, get it for $108 at their site. 8. The Frogpad Site: FrogPad.com [caption id=\"attachment_299\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"463\" caption=\"FrogPad Keyboard\"][/caption] The FrogPad, according to the site: FrogPad is a portable one-handed keyboard. It's practical, simple, and intuitive, 20-key text/numeric data entry design uses patented algorithms and ergonomic optimization providing all of the functionality of a standard keyboard. The full-size keys ensure accuracy, ease of use, and speed for all desktop and mobile computing applications. You know, it doesn't sound half-bad. Too bad it's not that practical unless you want to eat with one hand and type with another. (I know you do too! ;)) The maker claims up to 40 wpm after 6-10 hours with this thing. I'm not really sure about that. The thing is, where did frogpad come from, anyways? 7. New Standard Rainbow Keyboard Site: NewStandardKeyboards.com [caption id=\"attachment_300\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"New Standard Rainbow Keyboard\"][/caption] Besides the kiddish look, this keyboard has some major problems. First of all, they said the QWERTY layout was confusing. This, apparently, is arranged in a good order. To counter that, look at the placement of A and I! Anyways, apparently, QWERTY keyboards take up too much desk space and this solves many problems. Here's a few select testimonials from select sites: It's a logical, simplified, more efficient version of the illogical, complicated qwerty keyboard, a layout that takes less time to learn and less desk space. It's better in every way, in fact.\" -- Rupert Goodwins, ZDNet UK (Full Review) \"When I asked him which keyboard he liked better, he overwhelmingly chose the New Standard Keyboard.\" ..... \"This is a HUGE improvement over the QWERTY keyboard.\" -- Rich Smith, Developer Shed, Inc.(Full Review) 4 words. Give me a break. This keyboard isn't laid out properly! Anyways, order now for ONLY $70! 6. USB Cooler Keyboard Site: Can't find it! [caption id=\"attachment_301\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\" caption=\"Thanko&#39;s USB Cooler Keyboard\"][/caption] \"Dangit! I keep slipping off the keyboard again with my sweaty hands, wrist, and arms! Heck, I'm all sweaty all together!\" Never fear, the keyboard with fans is here! Who would have thought of something this ridiculous anyways? I guess they thought of bowling, perhaps, to come up with this ridiculous idea? \"Thank you, Thanko!\" 5. Grippity 1.0 Back-Typing Keyboard Site: Grippity.com Grippity Back-Typing Keyboard The Grippity Keyboard eliminates your fingers blocking the view of the keys so that you can actually see where you're typing! No more huge fingerss in the way! Just kidding. Here's what the folks at Grippity have to say: BackTyping is a brilliant yet simple ergonomic concept that allows full QWERTY typing in handheld devices. Typing as we know it hasn't changed since the invention of the typewriter machine, in 1867, 32 years before the U.S. patent commissioner declared \"Everything that can be invented has been invented.\" Typewriter machines made a long way, from the desks of the 19th century to the living room couch of the 21st century, without changing too much. The struggle of a 19th century clerk, leaning forward to his 10kg machine has no place in your living room, pocket or even on your desk. Also on the website includes the ergonomics of a regular palm. Think about it: what's more comfortable? A video game controller or a keyboard? This is what this manufacturer intends to solve. It actually doesn't seem like a bad concept. The hard part is the learning to type part, but other than that, it should be okay. The Grippity isn't on sale right now, but expect to see it in stores soon. 4. The iGrip Ergonomic Keyboard and Trackball Site: AlphaGrips.com [caption id=\"attachment_295\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"575\" caption=\"iGrip Keyboard\"][/caption] From AlphaGrips.com: Lean back from your desk Work and play how you want, where you want Be comfortable and productive Type 50+ words per minute from any location 50+ words per minute... that's a little unbelievable. How long would it to take to learn how to type on this thing, say 10, 20, 50, 100 hours to finally type that fast? It looks like a great way to play WoW or something except that it would be a little hard to get that trackball to your enemies during raids every time. What if you need to shout a quick \"need heals\" in less than 2 seconds while fighting a boss? You trackball down to your macro or type the number. That easy. This wouldn't be half bad if it were easier to control. A lot easier. Who knows? I might be wrong anyways. 3. The SafeType Vertical Keyboard Site: Safetype.com [caption id=\"attachment_294\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"549\" caption=\"The SafeType Keyboard - Available in Black Only...\"][/caption] The World's Best-Selling (and probably only) Vertical Keyboard, available in black only hence the picture, claims that a neutral position is with your hands sideways. Today's keyboards, apparently, are not ergonomic, so what did SafeType do? They made the keyboard go skyscraper! Here's what they have to say about the SafeType: It doesn't just move the problem to another area of the body. It eliminates the 3 most damaging postures: Extension Deviation Pronation It solves real problems, not imaginary ones. Here's what I have to say about that. First, it moves the problem to your poor tired shoulders which'll probably die of having to hold them up to the keyboard instead of on a wristpad or desk. It does not eliminate extension-- what if you have a high desk? It does eliminate deviation from a normal posture. And I don't know what pronation is, but that keyboard's just prone to fall and break! It has side mirrors like a car or bus to help you learn how to type on this in 90 minutes. I don't really see how mirrors help anyways... For $189, it's a steal. A steal of money that could have been spent on some other keyboard from you! 2. The Datahand Professional II Buy it on Amazon: Keyboard Pro II with Lg Palm Pad Serial [caption id=\"attachment_277\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"575\" caption=\"DataHand Professional II\"][/caption] No, it's not a scale. No, it's not a superhero costume. No, it's not one of those fancy hand-scanners they use in Area 51. It's just a $1,300 data input device. Don't believe me? If you look a little closer, each one of those fingers have 5 keys on them. Also, the thumbs provide a spacebar. Supposedly, it's a QWERTY keyboard that doesn't look like a QWERTY keyboard. Weird, huh? It also can be used as a mouse, if that actually works. 1. The orbiTouch Keyless Keyboard and Mouse Buy it on Amazon: orbiTouch Keyless Keyboard and Mouse [caption id=\"attachment_268\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"250\" caption=\"The OrbiTouch Keyless Keyboard - Yes, it&#39;s real.\"][/caption] I know the other keyboards are weird, but this one doesn't even have KEYS! Or buttons! Or anything to press! Basically, to type, you slide the orbs into positions to create a letter. It looks more like a show-off device since it look so hard to use. It looks like it came from planet Zorg or something... at least it's ergonomic. Programmers and coders, imagine typing something like \"if ($x === $y) {\" on that. That'll end up causing more RSI because of how long it takes! From the website: The orbiTouch® is a revolutionary keyless ergonomic keyboard solution that removes the barrier posed by the traditional keyboard/mouse combination. Persons who benefit include those with repetitive stress injuries such as carpal tunnel syndrome , other hand and finger injuries, limited fine motor skills, reduced finger function and other cognitive and physical challenges. The comfortable design of the orbiTouch® keyless ergonomic keyboard makes it the ideal tool for computing and accessing the Internet. Cognitive challenges? This is a cognitive challenge! Anyways, this keyboard also doubles as a mouse, which is a bonus. It's a crapload of money, though, for a keyboard. Try coughing up the $400 to buy a device that won't even type fast enough. Bonus: the Optimus Maximus Keyboard Buy it from ThinkGeek: Optimus Maximus Keyboard [caption id=\"attachment_276\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Optimus Maximus Keyboard - 113 screens total!\"][/caption] The Optimus Maximus Keyboard probably has the most screens out of any other keyboard. Heck, it's probably the only keyboard with at least 1 48x48 color LCD screen. Coming straight from the Russian designer Art Lebedev, this keyboard surely is one of a kind. Although it has a QWERTY keyboard by default, all keys can be customized. If you want a Dvorak keyboard layout for example, go for it! When you change applications, you don't have to stick with your keyboard. All keys can be customized to change graphics in different applications! The left side can be used for a sort of Quick Launch pad to get to applications faster. It can also be used for choosing Photoshop tools, etc. It's completely customizable! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWkjtnd367Q But with a great keyboard comes a steep price. The keyboard costs $1,600 on ThinkGeek.com, enough to buy a brand new laptop of spectacular quality.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Computer","slug":"Computer","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Computer/"},{"name":"Hardware","slug":"Computer/Hardware","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Computer/Hardware/"},{"name":"Tech","slug":"Computer/Hardware/Tech","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Computer/Hardware/Tech/"},{"name":"Weird","slug":"Computer/Hardware/Tech/Weird","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Computer/Hardware/Tech/Weird/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Weird","slug":"Weird","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/Weird/"},{"name":"abkey revolution","slug":"abkey-revolution","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/abkey-revolution/"},{"name":"alphagrips","slug":"alphagrips","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/alphagrips/"},{"name":"datahand professional II","slug":"datahand-professional-II","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/datahand-professional-II/"},{"name":"frogpad","slug":"frogpad","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/frogpad/"},{"name":"grippity","slug":"grippity","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/grippity/"},{"name":"igrip","slug":"igrip","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/igrip/"},{"name":"keyboard","slug":"keyboard","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/keyboard/"},{"name":"list","slug":"list","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/list/"},{"name":"new standard rainbow","slug":"new-standard-rainbow","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/new-standard-rainbow/"},{"name":"optimus maximus","slug":"optimus-maximus","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/optimus-maximus/"},{"name":"orbitouch","slug":"orbitouch","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/orbitouch/"},{"name":"safetype","slug":"safetype","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/safetype/"},{"name":"strange","slug":"strange","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/strange/"},{"name":"thanko","slug":"thanko","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/thanko/"},{"name":"top 10","slug":"top-10","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/top-10/"},{"name":"usb","slug":"usb","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/usb/"},{"name":"usb cooler","slug":"usb-cooler","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/usb-cooler/"}]},{"title":"Dontclick.it - A revolutionary way to navigate on computers","slug":"dontclick-it","date":"2010-02-10T07:11:18.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2010/02/10/dontclick-it/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2010/02/10/dontclick-it/","excerpt":"","text":"Imagine a world where mice didn't have buttons. Imagine the mouse only being able to move. Imagine that the whole internet was created for that. Hard to imagine, eh? Well, I stumbled upon this website, Dontclick.it. “Within this interface you wont find any buttons. Instead you navigate the contents in a different way. You will get the hang of it immediately.” Everyday, netizens navigate through links and play buttons and forms with the mouse button(s). Without the click, things like carpal tunnel and arthritis could be reduced. Sounds crazy, eh? The creator of this website believed that most of the time moving the mouse between clicks is usually \"dead space\". Therefore, he proposed and created this website to test how people react to a clickless environment. [caption id=\"attachment_257\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Dontclick.it&#39;s clickless interface\"][/caption] The site's navigation is very unique. Basically, you put your mouse over a page and the page opens underneath or on top, depending on what page you're looking at. The site contains information on how this feat could be accomplished, such as examples on \"clicking\" buttons without clicking and even a contact form. It's better not to click, anyways, from what I read on the ergonomics page. A click takes longer for the brain to process than a mouseover, apparently. Recent studies show that a bad interface can cause stress and heart problems. Also, without clicks, you will only use hands for typing; the rest is all arm. Maybe it's not as outlandish as it seems. [caption id=\"attachment_258\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"250\" caption=\"Weird Orb Keyboard\"][/caption] This orb keyboard was developed for a similar reason (yes, keyboard) and was built for aliens. (No, just kidding, but how are you actually supposed to type on this thing?) You slide around the orbs to choose letters. This also doubles as a mouse, so you do have to click. Nevertheless, it eliminates harmful key strokes that can cause carpal tunnel and arthritis. It may seem weird at first, but who knows? Anyways, the cool navigation entices you to explore the whole site. A lot of the parts look like buttons, so if you accidentally forget and click on the site, you must input if your click was either accidental or intentional. After that, the site asks if you like not having to click. I personally feel uncomfortable, but that's just me. The website is not only for entertainment but for research too. Who knows, one day we might all end up rolling a little ball around a table to navigate. In my opinion, we'll have some sort of a multitouch pad like the Apple Magic Mouse and use that to navigate around Web 4.0. One thing is for sure, though: we'll have to get rid of the whole existing infrastructure and it may take up to 200 years from now to do so.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Computer","slug":"Computer","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Computer/"},{"name":"Hardware","slug":"Computer/Hardware","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Computer/Hardware/"},{"name":"Internet","slug":"Computer/Hardware/Internet","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Computer/Hardware/Internet/"},{"name":"Tech","slug":"Computer/Hardware/Internet/Tech","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Computer/Hardware/Internet/Tech/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Internet","slug":"Internet","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/Internet/"},{"name":"cool","slug":"cool","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/cool/"},{"name":"dontclick.it","slug":"dontclick-it","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/dontclick-it/"},{"name":"ergonomics","slug":"ergonomics","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/ergonomics/"},{"name":"experiment","slug":"experiment","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/experiment/"},{"name":"mouse","slug":"mouse","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/mouse/"},{"name":"spiffy","slug":"spiffy","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/spiffy/"}]},{"title":"How to make your own .com website in 3 easy steps","slug":"how-to-make-your-own-com-website-in-3-easy-steps","date":"2010-02-08T19:44:52.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2010/02/08/how-to-make-your-own-com-website-in-3-easy-steps/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2010/02/08/how-to-make-your-own-com-website-in-3-easy-steps/","excerpt":"","text":"Many of you know how to do this already, but since it has been requested so many times to me by my classmates and colleagues, I will introduce you to this relatively easy process. If you still don't understand the structure of the Internet well enough, please read this article. [caption id=\"attachment_172\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Making your first .com website\"][/caption] Step 1: Buy your domain name and hosting As a quick recap, a domain name is an identifier for an IP address. Basically, a .com, .net, .org, .tk, whatever. Just remember that they're not free. (Believe me, many people have asked me this question.) BlueHost is a great hosting company with great support. For about $100/year, you can get a domain name and great hosting. I haven't experienced much downtime from them as compared to Yahoo!'s horrible web hosting, so I think it's a great starter host. A huge mistake, though, is getting your domain name linked with your hosting company. It can be very difficult to transfer a domain name to another account, so I recommend the GoDaddy domain registration service. It's the largest domain registrar in the world, so I believe it's a great choice. With GoDaddy, I've heard from others that HostGator is a great company to go with it. In conclusion, if you're planning to get bigger, get a GoDaddy/HostGator combo and don't link your domain name with your account. If you're small, get BlueHost. Step 2: Generate website content [caption id=\"attachment_217\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"250\" caption=\"The Wordpress Logo\"][/caption] Wordpress Now, with a website comes content. The easiest way to do that is to install Wordpress. Wordpress is basically a free blogging software. Wordpress is great for blogs of all sizes because of its speed, SEO, and extensibility. Wordpress is probably the best blogging software available. Best of all, it's free. To install it, use SimpleScripts or Fantastico -- both are included in most CPanels. There's a great tutorial in the Wordpress Codex on installing Wordpress, too. Setting up databases varies from host to host, so I can't really tell you how to set up your database. Once you get Wordpress, it should be really easy to fill up your website with content. HTML, CSS, PHP, and others Basically, HTML and CSS are the languages of the internet. (If you want to make a completely custom site, consider ordering HTML, XHTML, and CSS All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies.) To get your files onto your site, just make an FTP account, get Filezilla or something,and upload away. Step 3: Blast off! Now that you have your site up and running, tell the world! Tell friends and family! Advertise it! I found Facebook to be the most effective way, but do whatever you want. Go wild and make business cards! Slip the url into everyone's lockers! Anything to advertise your website!","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Internet","slug":"Internet","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Internet/"},{"name":"Wordpress","slug":"Internet/Wordpress","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Internet/Wordpress/"}],"tags":[{"name":"3 steps","slug":"3-steps","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/3-steps/"},{"name":"Internet","slug":"Internet","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/Internet/"},{"name":"Wordpress","slug":"Wordpress","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/Wordpress/"},{"name":"how to","slug":"how-to","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/how-to/"},{"name":"website","slug":"website","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/website/"}]},{"title":"Addicting Helicopter Game","slug":"addicting-helicopter-game","date":"2010-02-08T10:50:01.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2010/02/08/addicting-helicopter-game/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2010/02/08/addicting-helicopter-game/","excerpt":"","text":"If you still remember the site \"Club Uber\", this was one of the most popular games on the site.

Just the other day, I was talking to someone about domain names and they asked me, \"What's a domain name?\" I replied, \"An easier way to remember an IP.\" \"What's an IP?\" To those of you who are now shifting guiltily in your seats, I didn't mean to offend you. The thing is, most schools before high school don't teach internet infrastructure in science class or any other class. Most adults weren't in school during the advent of the dot com bubble. Therefore, mostly college kids know about this stuff. The basic knowledge of how the internet works is a necessity. This is the future. I will present this information to you in noob form. I'm sorry; people who don't know basic information like this can be considered noobs. So, what is the Internet? The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks. It's like the universe in a way; every universe has galaxies and stars in it, etc. In other words, every website you see is part of a computer, not an entity. There is no central storage unit that keeps the internet. It uses a thing called \"TCP/IP\" to connect to each other. But how does the computer give me information? These computers, called servers, are all connected to the Internet, just like your computer. The difference between your computer and servers is that they have a special software installed that allows the computer to be displayed on the internet freely. You can do it too with something like the Apache Web Server. Some types of servers include: Web Servers, which convey websites to browsers Email Servers, such as POP3, IMAP, and SMTP, which allow email to be sent or recieved by communicating with other servers Database Servers, which store and send data So how am I able to connect to the Internet? The Internet can be accessed through Internet Service Providers, or ISPs. ISPs include Time Warner Cable, AT&amp;T, and the like. Basically they link you to the wires that link the Internet together, just like a telephone system. Once again, there is no central entity. A good simile would be like the Hindu Brahma. Brahma is in every living thing. There is no central Brahma. Similarly, every computer connected to the Internet is part of the Internet. How does a website work? Here's a good example of a website: my website. My website is hosted on the servers of BlueHost Inc., which means that my website is a bunch of files and data inside of their computers. The .com part of my website is called a domain, and that domain is assigned to the IP address of my site, kind of like a shortcut. When you go to my website, you connect to the internet through the network of wires, cables, and antennas throughout the world. You basically tell my website to send you something called HTML, and my website sends you the HTML and information all in less than a second on good days. So there you have it.","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Internet","slug":"Internet","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Internet/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Internet","slug":"Internet","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/Internet/"},{"name":"domain","slug":"domain","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/domain/"},{"name":"how","slug":"how","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/how/"},{"name":"ip","slug":"ip","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/ip/"},{"name":"isp","slug":"isp","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/isp/"},{"name":"tcp/ip","slug":"tcp-ip","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/tcp-ip/"}]},{"title":"Apple iPad: My First Impressions","slug":"apple-ipad-first-impressions","date":"2010-02-03T10:03:49.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2010/02/03/apple-ipad-first-impressions/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2010/02/03/apple-ipad-first-impressions/","excerpt":"","text":"Just recently, on January 27, Apple finally revealed their highly speculated iPad. It's happening all over again. The complaints. The bashing. The jokes. But we all know that once the iPad does come out in March, and people start to line up to get their iPads, and people go home and play Giant Doodle Jump or something on their new \"Pads\", we'll have the iPad websites starting to open up all over the place. (Here's a prediction: iPadIllustrated.com -- your source for iPad related technologies.) The iPad, which is basically the iPod Touch gone supersized, is a tiny computer with about the same sized screen as a netbook (9.7\") and half an inch thick. Its irremovable battery reportedly lasts 10 hours while doing who knows what and a month of standby. It will come in 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB sizes and range from $499 to $830. Many would (especially now) consider the iPad to be useless, or at least not worth the $499, but I disagree. Critics rave about how a netbook is better for $499 -- faster, more apps, better. The problem is, the iPad was not intended to be a replacement for the common netbook; the iPad blurs the line between mobile device and tablet/netbook.While the iPad does have basically the same functionality as the iPod Touch, it still is faster and can open up new multitouch possibilities. There's only so much functionality that can be fit onto a tiny 480x320 resolution screen. With a 1024x768 screen and a custom-made 1GHz processor to create better software, the iPad will be able to do so much more but still offer a netbook's portability. Here's a big pro: iWork. iWork apps are estimated to cost about $10 a piece, much less than Word's 4 for $300 Ofice Student Edition. I don't know of any other mobile devices that support document creation built for a multitouch screen. There's Windows mobile, but it isn't multitouch. Word 2010 isn't built for multitouch. Therefore, this'll be great. The problem is, it'll be very hard to type using a virtual keyboard. That's why Apple is also offering a keyboard dock that doubles as a stand. But once you do this, I can't imagine how hard it it would be to see the screen's bottom while your fingers are right above it. Many are also talking about this being the Kindle killer. That's BS. First of all, it sucks as an e-reader. Say you're reading a book in the park, or more realistically, the train to work (not me) or just outside. The glare from the solid glass screen will probably show you the sky most of the time, so unless you turn the brightness all the way up to maximum, you won't be able to read in peace. More to that, the iPad will most likely default to half brightness, so if you turn it all the way up, Steve Jobs's 10 hours will turn into 5 hours when new, 1-2 hours after a year of use. The e-books are in color, I know, and the iPad has a backlight, I know, but the whole point of not having a backlight was to let you read outside. The Kindle, Nook, and Sony e-readers all use e-ink which uses up much less energy. (The only energy actually used is with turning a page and the wireless.) The 3Qi screen is coming out soon, if you've heard of it, so it'll be in color. Who needs video and audio for $5 more per book anyways? The reason people will use it is out of convenience. Word will go around though that the screen is hard to read on in the park and it doesn't last very long. And the backlight issue: didn't your mom ever tell you not to read in the dark anyway? Youtube looks like it'll be great on this device; if it gets Netflix, I'm going to jump out of my seat and preorder it. Too bad that probably won't happen. Unfortunately, 16:9 widescreen won't be supported. The screen look like it could also work for web browsing. Here's for fun: I actually heard someone talk about using Skype on this thing. Imagine talking into a huge thing like this. Sorry, it made me crack up... :p So, in conclusion, here are the major product wins and fails. Wins Large, 1024x768 screen 3G is only $30/month unlimited It's about the price of a good netbook or cheap tablet It looks awesome! Giant Doodle Jump! XD Imagine watching videos on this thing. Fails The screen isn't 16:9 widescreen. You're stuck with AT&amp;T. It's not exactly light at 1.5 lbs. It cannot multitask. It can false-multitask with push notifications like the iPhone/Touch, but not multitask. There isn't a front-facing webcam or even a camera, so video conferences etc. aren't happening. No flash again! It really stinks missing out on this thing with a 1 GHz processor. I think Apple's trying to sneak in a monopoly by forcing companies to write apps! The ebooks will ultimately fail. Most likely, people are going to buy them, though. Imagine that naked screen in your laptop bag. I don't think people are going to sell iPad skins. Overall, I think that the iPad isn't exactly worth it at the moment. Hopefully I'll get one for Christmas, if there isn't any competitor out there to stop me. I also might get a Nook, but I don't know what's coming out yet. Nobody can determine the outcome of the iPad yet, but I think it will be a smidge less successful than the iPhone's start. Special thanks to Wizkidweb's helpful blog post that inspired me to write this. Sorry for stealing your title and pictures! It's nothing like a netbook: no CD drive, no USB ports, etc.But it's not fair to compare it to a netrr","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Apple","slug":"Apple","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Apple/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Apple","slug":"Apple","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/Apple/"},{"name":"browser","slug":"browser","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/browser/"},{"name":"first impressions","slug":"first-impressions","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/first-impressions/"},{"name":"ipad","slug":"ipad","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/ipad/"},{"name":"review","slug":"review","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/review/"},{"name":"wizkidweb","slug":"wizkidweb","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/wizkidweb/"}]},{"title":"Pants on the Ground","slug":"pants-on-the-ground","date":"2010-01-15T10:17:26.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2010/01/15/pants-on-the-ground/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2010/01/15/pants-on-the-ground/","excerpt":"","text":"Pants on the ground Pants on the ground Lookin like a fool with you pants on the ground Gold in your mouth Hat turned sideways pants hit the ground Call yourself a cool cat looking like a fool Walking down town With your pants on the ground!

It works!\" \"It's easier to do with what we have now.\" I'm not exactly a complete hater of Internet Explorer (actually I am), but here's the straight-out truth: Internet Explorer stinks. (No, I'm not the only one.) I'm not calling it the worst browser. (Actually, it is.) People still use it because it comes prepackaged with a new Windows computer, it's hard to remove, and many are just not tech-friendly. Last summer, I went to New Jersey to see my relatives. Guess what? All of them used the crappy Internet Explorer 6 or 7, and when I told them about Firefox, they said it would slow down their computer. This is a myth; Firefox makes your computer faster. I never convinced them to use Firefox, but they had a lot of viruses. (This has been fixed because of IE 8) This is not an \"I love Firefox\" post, so I will cover seven big reasons, not in any particular order, why exactly not to use Internet Explorer. 1. Cross-browser compatibility - IE is not the most compatible browser. It lacks many things relating to CSS, Javascript, and other things. Many sites also claim they are \"optimized for IE only\" so not using IE would help protest it. Some major CSS details are not in IE. 2. Address Bar - The address bar, like all browsers, is the gateway to the Internet. Having a good address bar can dramatically reduce the time it takes to get to websites. Both Firefox and Chrome are great in their searches in history or bookmarks. IE does this, but it is less visually-appealing. 3. Speed - Internet Explorer's speed is HORRENDOUS. The page-to-page speed is barely slower, but the startup speed is like a snail. The fade effects when opening menus take a small but critical half of a second to load. 4. Nuisance Dialog Boxes - Whenever I use Internet Explorer, I get \"Do you want to turn AutoComplete on?\" \"Do you want to remember this password?\" At least put it at the top like in Firefox/Chrome! 5. The Spazzing Cursor - When I go to a page, what do I see? A spazzing cursor. The hourglass (or circle-loader in Vista) flickers when downloading something. Is is just me or is that just plain annoying? 6. Two processes - I don't have to really explain this, but why in the world are there TWO processes of iexplore.exe? 7. Low extensibility - Internet Explorer is missing one huge thing that other browsers have -- a wide range of addons, extensions, themes, etc. The default Internet Explorer theme is dull but it's as good as you'll get. Plugins are all by major developers (Bebo, AIM, delicious, etc.) so I don't see something good like AdblockPlus coming soon. This was the ONLY good thing about IE7, now it's gone. See: open source really is a necessity. Conclusion There are many other great browsers out there. If you're having trouble picking, I recommend you go to BrowseHappy to find your perfect browser or just keep reading my blog.

Even I say to my parents or brother, \"Just Google it.\" Google has become a generic term for using a search engine. But why do people like Google so much? Many say it's a very simple engine, but most use it because they don't know of any other search engines. Yes, Google is the most popular, but there are others too. So here's the big question: what is the best search engine? [gallery] The front page Yahoo's is the WORST. (I'm sorry, Yahoo, you still have some good products.) The top of the screen looks really empty and you can't even tell if you're logged in or not. I mean, at least include that little blue gradient at the top so it looks like something... The placement makes the search area abnormally wide. This is simplicity a step too far. Google's is better. When I visited their page, it displayed just the logo and the search bar. When I moved my mouse, it displayed the rest of the page. (I don't really understand why.) Now you see all of their services in the top left, your login status in the top right, and the search in the middle. It's well-placed and simple except for the images access; you have to search first to get to it. Very simple. It's boring but it gets the job done. Obviously, Bing is the most colorful. Bing's front page showed me a town called \"Broome, Australia\" and provided a lot of facts hidden on the page in secret areas. It gives easy access to all of the different types of search. The colors match and all is well. Even people who like simplicity will be dragged in with this simple but colorful design. You have easy access to their Hotmail service in the top left (use Gmail for email), account settings in the top right, and the content in the middle. It has by far the best splash page. All of the search engines were fast and had auto-complete. The search query Yahoo's is still the worst. With a thin layout and distracting backgrounds, this is the worst out of the three. Google's is somewhat better. It's simple and fast. The thing is, it doesn't look all too great. It's very bland and boring but is functional. Bing's is great. With the search history on the side, you can easily get back to previous searches. The logo is not boring at all. There is a little \"preview\" arrow on the side to show the text content from the pages. (Well at least part of it.) You can add Facebook friends easily with this tool. Image Search Yahoo's image search is good. It shows recent images and the like. For some reason, it has ads. It's functional, but not all that good. It has the options of the other two with a checkbox-like selection menu. Google has a very large database of images. When searched with \"ian macalinao,\" it showed a lot of pictures from my blog. It's comprehensive but simple. It doesn't have the huge amount of options like... Bing. Bing lets you choose whether you want to show just the images or the full details. When showing just the images, hover over the image and it shows the details. It has the same options as the other two, but it's easier to find the options. Conclusion Bing is definitely the best search engine of 2009. It improved a lot off of Live search. Google is still the search engine king, but if people decided to just switch to Bing and stick with it, Bing will grow on them. Google has the most market share, though, so it should be checked when doing SEO etc. Bing, however, is very relevant. Bing rules.

We learn reading. We learn writing. We learn arithmetic. Now we also learn history and science. We are trained to be good workers, too. But why? The school system originated in Prussia about 200 years ago to create \"good employees.\" Basically, we are expected to do the normal -- get a job, retire, die. But how about the percentage of people who want to OWN businesses? That requires management of money. Unfortunately, from all the schools I have been to, none of them teach a thing about money except weird math problems nobody needs. Most do not know the difference between assets and liabilities; that is very simple. You are expected to learn it on your own. Many would say \"it's easy to learn that you should save money,\" but how about the number of people in credit card debt? Illegitimate! Back to about school, there are still more things wrong. What's with the relearning of information? I don't see why this is. The first six or so weeks in a school year are spent on reviewing last year's information. Pointless. This is mainly because of summer break. Why does it have to be 14 week long where you forget about everything? I know that it's for farmers and all (which most of us are not) but why is America assuming that we're farmers? Maybe a 4 week summer break would actually be suitable to at least people living in cities and have 1 week breaks every 2 or 3 weeks. Also, there is the issue of homework. Why go to school when you must do work at home? I understand essays and projects and all that but what about math homework? You learn the math at school then you do homework at home. Why can't we just be assessed based on our tests, quizzes, or classwork? For the challenged and behind, they could do homework. For the really good kids who think it's a waste of time, let us NOT do homework. It should be extra credit. Overall, there are many things wrong with school systems today that need to be fixed. If I had the chance, I would change everything to this ideal school. The year-round thing is really something that should be considered. Most of all, just fix our schools!","raw":null,"content":null,"categories":[{"name":"Opinions","slug":"Opinions","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/categories/Opinions/"}],"tags":[{"name":"School","slug":"School","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/School/"},{"name":"america","slug":"america","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/america/"},{"name":"prussia","slug":"prussia","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/prussia/"},{"name":"screwed","slug":"screwed","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/tags/screwed/"}]},{"title":"My computer is totally screwed up.","slug":"my-computer-is-totally-screwed-up","date":"2009-12-08T10:44:17.000Z","updated":"2015-11-10T16:02:22.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2009/12/08/my-computer-is-totally-screwed-up/","link":"","permalink":"https://simplyian.com/2009/12/08/my-computer-is-totally-screwed-up/","excerpt":"","text":"My computer is screwed up.

I started out spending about 4 hours trying to follow this tutorial, but I never succeeded. Out of frustration, I decided to terraform the region. As you can see, I started out by Teel/Lebanon. When I tried to add Bledsoe Elementary school, the range of the elementary school was limited and could not reach to the areas it covers in real life. I mean really, they should allow that! They don't even let buses go there in real life since Bledsoe is so close to the Teel/Lebanon community! (less than 2 miles) So anyways, I rest my case that Sim City 4 still needs to be improved. I even like Sim City 3K Unlimited since although it looks worse, it has way less glitches. (this is not a glitch, but still...)

I decided to look it up on Wikipedia -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenu. On the news, he talked about Xenu being a supreme emperor of the Galactic Empire, and he brought the humans to Earth 75 million years ago in spaceships resembling DC-8s. We had to leave, so I looked it up here at school and I'll tell you the basic story. 75 million years ago, dictator Xenu of the Galactic Empire of 26 stars and 76 planets including Earth decided that his Empire was becoming overpopulated. (an average of 178 billion lived on each planet) He decided to bring some of his people to Earth in DC-8-like starships without engines to go and place them around volcanoes. He would then place hydrogen bombs in the volcanoes and kill them. Then he would force the spirits (called \"thetans\") to watch a 3D movie for 36 days to teach them about God, the Devil, space opera (alien civilizations), etc. Then after watching this movie, they would gather in clusters and infect the humans that were still alive with these beliefs by means of using \"body thetans\" to go inside of people. Only scientologists can remove these body thetans. Xenu from South Park A government faction called the Loyal Officers overthrew Xenu &amp; Co. and locked him up inside of an electronic mountain trap (of which he has not escaped) believed to be in the Pyreenes. The cost for learning this secret in 1988 was $6,500. If you did not experience the benefits of this course, you were expected to take it and pay for it again. This story (or fact claimed by Scientologists) is called \"OT III - The Wall of Fire.\" Anyways, Tom Cruise bought into this stuff and a bunch of other people. Scientology is more like a business. This story very much seems like science fiction, so I don't know why people believe in this stuff. This Scientology cult is really weird.

It started when I was at the Saturday Dallas Wordpress Meetup and I tried to buy a domain for my friend, Jeff. It said my password was wrong, so we ignored it for a while since Bluehost did that before. After an hour, we decided to call Bluehost support, and they said our credentials were wrong. We had to call the Bluehost Abuse Office and all that, but we eventually got everything back. Luckily, everything was left untouched. (I think.) Out of curiosity, I went to the edit profile page. The following came up: Apparently, the guy who hacked the account changed the credentials to a guy (or girl) named Karen Chand, a person living in Wednesfield, UK. I looked up the address on Google Maps: This guy has a legit address AND a legit credit card. I mean it's really annoying when you get hacked; everyone freaks out and you get stressed. It's like, \"Omg a guy hacked my account now he has our account stuff!\" I mean seriously, it's not good to make people feel miserable. The only thing good about this is that we have an address. But I found something else that's bad: the email address. Wednesfield@cardenro.com The URL cardenro.com contains the following: Internal Server Error The server encountered an internal error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request. Please contact the server administrator, webmaster@cardenro.hacker2860.com and inform them of the time the error occurred, and anything you might have done that may have caused the error. More information about this error may be available in the server error log. Additionally, a 500 Internal Server Error error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request. Also, the URL cardenro.com is traced to a Miriam Garcia of Sunnyvale, CA. This is a private registration, though, with the email address of contact@myprivateregistration.com. Also, note the cardenro.hacker2860.com. Hacker2860.com is not a registered domain name, but I found some results to hacker2860 showing him as a Thai person. He is probably a hacker who just hacks for fun. At least my blog didn't get hacked. Anyways, either Karen Chand is a hacker, a Thai guy stole an identity and credit card, or Karen Chand is Thai.
