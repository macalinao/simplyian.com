## Setup

First, run `npm install` to get all of our dependencies. Then run `npm install -g hexo` so you can run [Hexo][hexo] commands.

Last, run `git submodule update --init` to install [my theme][hexo-theme-simplyian].

Publishing is done through [Hexo][hexo], an awesome open-source blogging engine on Node.js. I suggest you check it out!
