## Setup

First, run `npm install` to get all of our dependencies. Then run `npm install -g hexo` so you can run [Hexo][hexo] commands.

Last, run `git submodule update --init` to install [my theme][hexo-theme-simplyian].

Publishing is done through [Hexo][hexo], an awesome open-source blogging engine on Node.js. I suggest you check it out!

## Writing a post

First run `hexo new post "<title>"` to create a `.md` file. This file will contain your blog post.

To publish the post, run `hexo g -d` to generate and deploy the new static files.
