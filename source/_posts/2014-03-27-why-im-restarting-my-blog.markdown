Today, I've decided I'm going to restart my blog. This blog used to be a place
where I talked about random things that I found cool, interesting, random,
frustrating, or anything really. I've moved on from this blog since I entered
high school, and now I'm wishing that I had it again.

I'm restarting the blog mainly for these reasons:

1. **To improve my writing skills.** I write terribly, and I always have. I hope
   this blog will enable me to start writing cohesively.
2. **To express my growing knowledge.** I don't know many people who are
   interested in things like Linux or Java. The friends I do have that are
   interested in that stuff certainly are not interested in me explaining how that
   stuff works. Instead, I'll be blogging to people who are interested in my
   content. Talking about something I've learned also lets me learn the topic
   better myself.
3. **To make myself more productive.** I've recently become addicted to gaming
   (Titanfall, League of Legends, etc.) and I want to stop playing so much. 
   Writing about programming will hopefully make me program more.

I'm hoping to be able to blog daily and at least every 3 days. I really hope
this blog ends up fulfilling all of my goals.
