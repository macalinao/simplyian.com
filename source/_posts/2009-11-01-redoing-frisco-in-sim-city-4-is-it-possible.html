<p>Many of you know I'm from Frisco, etc. So for Future City today, I decided to try and remake the region.</p>
<p>I started out spending about 4 hours trying to follow<a href="http://www.simtropolis.com/omnibus/index.cfm/Main.SimCity_4.Custom_Content.How_To_Make_Scale_Accurate_Realistic_Regions_from_USGS_Data"> this tutorial</a>, but I never succeeded. Out of frustration, I decided to terraform the region.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-44" title="frisco" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/frisco.png" alt="A miserable failure." width="581" height="435" /></p>
<p>As you can see, I started out by Teel/Lebanon. When I tried to add Bledsoe Elementary school, the range of the elementary school was limited and could not reach to the areas it covers in real life. I mean really, they should allow that! They don't even let buses go there in real life since Bledsoe is so close to the Teel/Lebanon community! (less than 2 miles)</p>
<p>So anyways, I rest my case that Sim City 4 still needs to be improved. I even like Sim City 3K Unlimited since although it looks worse, it has way less glitches. (this is not a glitch, but still...)</p>
<p>Centennial Medical Center would be WAY too far from the area, and so would Frisco High. Everything had to be cramped here. I really wish I could have built a successful Frisco in this city; it would have been nice.</p>
