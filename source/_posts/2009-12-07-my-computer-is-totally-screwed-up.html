<p>My computer is screwed up. I said it. It is totally messed up and probably uber-fragmented. I can't wait to get the parts for my new computer.<br />
Anyways, basically what happens is I have to go through system restore every time I want to use the computer. It is time consuming and boring. What I need is a brand-new computer with really good parts.<br />
Referring to my last post, I think I'll get that computer now.</p>
