<p><a href="http://i.dcritic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Alfa-Romeo-Sloth.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-821" title="Sloth" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Alfa-Romeo-Sloth-300x211.jpg" alt="Sloth" width="300" height="211" /></a>I have to admit, I’ve been pretty lazy with this blog.<br />
I haven’t posted since last year, and my common excuse is homework overload.<br />
Because of this, I haven’t had readers. I should have about 300 posts right now, but laziness killed me.<br />
<!--more--><br />
I’ve been playing a wacky game called Grepolis, got a guitar, went to various school-related activities in hotels, got Civilization 5, etc. But that should not stop me from doing what I should be doing.<br />
Even if a blog post is as short as this one, I shouldn’t just fail to blog. Consistency is the key to success.<br />
If you look at all of those people who are doing well – Facebook guy, Steve Jobs, even the founder of Quizlet – you can see that they had a hobby which they stuck with.<br />
While this blog post may just be written to myself and only about 5 people will read it, it doesn’t matter.<br />
What does matter is that I will be changing my habits from this day on. Even if I have a Mac. I need to be like what I was back in March last year.<br />
So anyways, I will be starting a funky new project called OrestesFW. It will be a framework in which I build other sites off of. I hope to build a Quizlet clone to someday. I will get that framework up and running by the end of the summer.<br />
I will be blogging more often, once every two days at least.<br />
Anyways, to sum this up, laziness is the key to failure. I just wasted a year of my life and I hope to never do that again.</p>
