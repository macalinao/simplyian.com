<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>n English class, we have an assignment to memorize a bit of a Shakespeare play. I, bored, wrote up a simple program in about an hour to test you on how well you know the individual lines of a text file. If you don't specify a file, it defaults to the first part of the famous St. Crispen's day speech in <em>Henry V</em>. Here's a link to the Bitbucket project: <a href="https://bitbucket.org/simplyianm/cordelia">https://bitbucket.org/simplyianm/cordelia</a>. You can download <em>cordelia-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</em> at that site. The program is  contained within a zip file. For Windows users, double click the <em>run.bat</em> file. For Mac users, it's a little trickier -- navigate to the directory where the unzipped files are in Terminal and type in "sh run.sh". For Linux, run the sh file. (I haven't used Linux in a while so I don't know the exact process)</p>
