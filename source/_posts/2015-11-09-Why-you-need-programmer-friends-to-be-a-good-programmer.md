title: Why you need programmer friends to be a good programmer

When people ask me when I first started programming, I always give two dates: the time when I wrote my first line of code, and the time that I first developed a passion and deep understanding for it.

Why were there two dates? The first one was a fluke -- it was when I accidentally discovered HTML and CSS from Neopets, an online virtual pet game that allowed you to create webpages for your pets. From then until the beginning of 9th grade, I learned HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL (not even JavaScript).

Basically, I was one of those shitty web developers you could find on eLance that lacked a fundamental understanding of how things worked. I just copied and pasted until things worked, and things that seem trivial to me now felt like major achievements back then.

Here is some of my archaic code from those days:

* [Mystery Glass][mysteryglass]
