While there have been many lasers that can track down missles etc, there hasn't been one until now for something we all know and hate: the mosquito. The machine was invented by astrophysicist Lowell Wood to kill large numbers of mosquitoes and prevent malaria. Watch this mosquito as its head gets fried by a blue ray gun!<br />

<p>Coming soon: the Star Wars Mosquito Defense System!</p>

<p>With this, expect to be finding phasers in your local weapons store by 2020. Laser guns will be the future, I'm afraid. Silent ammunition. Ingenious. No wait -- I forgot: Pyu! Pyu!</p>
<p>Live long and prosper.</p>
