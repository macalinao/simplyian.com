<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-515" href="http://i.dcritic.com/2010/02/25/what-is-the-game/lose-the-game/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-515" title="Lose the Game" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/lose-the-game.jpg" alt="Lose the Game" width="168" height="151" /></a><span class="drop_cap">H</span>ave you ever heard someone talk about <strong>The Game</strong>? Have you at least ever heard someone say <strong><em>you lost The Game</em></strong>? After that, have you gotten mad at them and asked them what the game was? Then they talk about <strong>losing the game</strong> again and you are just plain confused? Here is what the game is.<br />
<!--more-->The Game's name is called "The Game". There are only three rules to the game.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you know what <strong>The Game</strong> is, you are playing the game.</li>
<li>When you <strong>think of The Game</strong>, you <strong>lose The Game</strong>.</li>
<li>Every time you <strong>Lose the Game<span style="font-weight: normal;">, you must announce, "</span>I lost the game.</strong>"</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, <strong>you just lost The Game.</strong></p>
<p>This is probably the <strong>world's most infamous mind virus</strong>. Please feel free to infect your friends with this virus by either sharing this post or just simply telling them about it.</p>
<p>I first heard about the game while at the SMU TAG program. Everyone was saying, "I lost The Game" in class in unison constantly, so after about a week, I asked a friend what The Game was. He replied that "you don't want to know". After nagging him for a few seconds about it, he finally told me the <strong>rules of The Game</strong>, shown above. I immediately announced my loss, he did, then I was in on this <strong>mind virus.</strong></p>
<p>According to one resource, the game was created in London. Nobody knows for sure, though.</p>
<p>By the way, this is called "ironic processing" -- where you think about something by trying not to think about it.</p>
<p>Here's the best resource on The Game: <a title="The Game" href="http://www.losethegame.com/">The Game</a></p>
<p>Happy Gaming!</p>
<p>Oh, and to win The Game, you have to completely forget that The Game exists! Have fun doing that!</p>
