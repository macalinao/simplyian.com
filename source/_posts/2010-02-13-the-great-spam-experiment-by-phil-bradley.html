Since I get so many spam emails every day, I decided that it was about time to look up where exactly spam comes from.<br />
<!--more--></p>
<h2>Where do we get spam from?</h2>
<p>In common with about everyone else on the net I get spam emails flooding 		into my email box every day. In a dizzyingly short period of time I have the 		opportunity of achieving a larger penis along with enormous breasts, I can 		become a millionaire overnight, presumably the day after fixing my credit 		rating, I can take viagra to last longer with the woman that I hypnotised into 		bed, while watching nubile young ladies perform for me on webcam by paying them 		via the credit card that I've just been guaranteed. Spam is that amazing 		creation that allows all the crackpots, the fraudsters and the cheats to not 		only knock on our doors but to walk right in and make themselves at home.</p>
<p>I've read a lot about how to stop spam - how to filter it out, how to 		report the people who do it, how to blacklist the people who send it to you, 		and how to track them down to real accounts - and all very interesting it is 		too. However, despite having spent some time looking around on the Web, I've 		not really seen anything that looks at how you actually get it in the first 		place. Yes, I know that spammers get your email address, which then gets added 		to lists and sold onto other disreputable people who fill your mailbox with 		junk, but I was interested in seeing how they got the email address in the 		first place. How widely spread would your address need to be in order to catch 		the attention of the spammers? As it turns out, not very widely spread at all, 		as we shall see.</p>
<h2>How I went looking for spam, and how spam found me</h2>
<p>I decided to create some email accounts, and then publicise this at 		various places on the web. I chose to use Hotmail for this purpose for a number 		of reasons - it was quick and easy to create accounts, Hotmail accounts are 		very common (who doesn't have one?), I could inspect them whenever and wherever 		I chose and it also meant that I wouldn't be getting any more spam than 		necessary in my own email box.</p>
<p>I created a number of accounts that would be used for different 		purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 'control' account that wouldn't be published anywhere
<ul>
<li>I felt that this was important since I wanted to be able to 				discount any emails that had been sent out to addresses that had been created 				by a computer program. Consequently all my accounts were a variant on my name, 				with a numeric value after them. Any email that came into the control account 				could then be ignored in all the other accounts, since it had not originated 				from one of the accounts I was publicising.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An account that was only publicised in the Hotmail directory and 		  Internet White pages.
<ul>
<li>I suspect that many people do not think to untag that option when 				they create an account, and I wanted to see if I got any spam as a result.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Putting the address on a webpage, in an HTML mailto: link.
<ul>
<li>I used my own website at <a href="http://www.philb.com/">http://www.philb.com/</a> for this purpose. 				Granted that it's not the largest site in the world, but I like to think that 				it gets enough visitors to warrant its use for that purpose, and the site is 				also to be found by in most of the search engine indexes as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Posting to a mailing list
<ul>
<li>I joined, and then posted to a Library and Information Science 				related mailing list (LIS-LINK) at <a href="http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/">JISCMail</a> This isn't a particularly high 				volume list, but it does have its moments, and all the postings are publically 				archived for anyone to view.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Posting to a newsgroup
<ul>
<li>I registered another email account at 				<a href="http://www.google.com/grphp">Google groups</a> and posted once there. 				I wasn't sure quite which group to post to, since I wanted to post to a fairly 				well known one, which had a lot of postings, but I also wanted to try and 				ensure that I didn't skew the results by posting to a group with a very 				specific interest; if I'd posted to a sex group for example I wouldn't have 				been sure if any pornographic spam was just being targetted at posters to that 				newsgroup. Eventually I played safe and posted to <a href="news:alt.test">alt.test</a> which as the name suggests, is for posting 				test messages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A pornographic organisation
<ul>
<li>Obviously I knew that by requested pornography in my inbox, that 				was exactly what I was going to get. However, what really interested me here 				was to see if my address would be harvested as spam and sold onto other 				organisations who would use it for their own mailings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An opt-out list
<ul>
<li>In my early days on the Internet I once emailed back somone who 				had sent something to a nonsense address at one of my accounts to tell them 				that 'niko.hk' wasn't to be found there, and to take that name off whatever 				list they had. From that day to this, I've received email for this rather 				strangely named individual, so I had my suspicions that this probably wasn't 				going to be a good idea. I chose one of the spam emails that I get in my normal 				account and visited the website address as suggested and input the address of 				my next email account. I was gratified to read that my name had been taken off 				their list and I wouldn't get any more mail from them - this was obviously 				going to be a quiet account!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> group
<ul>
<li>This final one was an afterthought, but a couple of people 				suggested to me that it might be a good idea, since they had received spam as a 				result of posting to various Yahoo! groups, so I duly created another account 				and joined a business related newsgroup and posted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I could have chosen many other places to publicise different addresses - 		there are plenty of other groups other than those provided by Yahoo! for 		example, and I also wasn't taking into account the spam that arises as a result 		of visiting particular websites. However, odd though it may seem, I do have a 		life and I wanted to make the most of the short summer months in England. 		Besides, I have clients who need work to be done for them, so I drew a halt at 		that point.</p>
<p>Having set up the accounts, registered with the various services 		mentioned, and posted one single copy of each email address I then sat back and 		waited to see if my spam traps would work. I didn't have long to wait...</p>
<h2>Spam, spam, glorious spam!</h2>
<p>I had my first spam message inside a couple of hours, and it was to the 		email account I used to opt-out of mailings. To be honest, this wasn't exactly 		a surprise to me, and I was soon to discover opting out of a mailing list is 		like wandering into the rapids just wearing a small life protector - you're 		going to get swept along very quickly and end up drowning! Initially I was 		quite fascinated to see how much spam I was getting, and checked the accounts a 		couple of times a day, but after a while the thrill began to pall - after all 		it does get a bit depressing to realise that so many people think I've got a 		small penis and no money in my bank account! Eventually I ended up checking 		them once every couple of weeks, just to make sure that they were still active.</p>
<p>I was also very wryly amused at how many of the spam emails assured me 		that I was only getting their messages because I'd visited their sites and 		requested to be kept informed about their various products - in fact once or 		twice I almost doubted myself and thought about checking to see if there was 		anything like sleep-computing! However, I was fairly convinced that even if I 		had been computing in my sleep I wouldn't be visiting sites about septic tanks, 		of which I seemed to get a lot of emails, entreating me to purchase one and 		improve my lifestyle. Quite how a septic tank is going to improve my lifestyle 		I'm none too sure - after all, 'Come up and see my septic tank' isn't exactly 		going to work wonders is it.</p>
<h2>Spam winners, spam losers</h2>
<p>Eventually however all good things must come to an end. Summer began to 		fade and autumn decided it was time to come out and romp and play, and I too 		decided that after about 10 weeks it was time to draw my spam experiment to an 		end. I was then faced with the enormity of going through each account in turn 		and adding up columns of figures.</p>
<p>Rather than simply add up the number of emails I had received it had 		been suggested to me that it would be interesting to to classify them somehow. 		This appealed to me - after all, my background is that of a librarian, so a 		little bit of classification couldn't come amiss. It didn't take long to work 		out some major categories - I just had to look at the titles of the emails that 		I'd been sent. Regretfully I decided that I didn't have enough time to open 		each one in turn to read the contents - I would simply have to assign a 		category based either on the subject of the email or if that wasn't always 		clear, on the name of the sender, which usually was. Faced with an email with 		the subject 'come and see my website' wasn't necessarily very clear, but when 		it had been sent by 'SexySuzie' it didn't take too much working out! However, 		in cases where it really wasn't clear the email was assigned to the wonderful 		'miscellaneous' category.</p>
<p>The categories that I used were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial
<ul>
<li>Anything offering to repair my credit, make me a millionaire, 				find me a cheaper mortgage and so on went here</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pornographic
<ul>
<li>Fairly self explanatory I'd have thought.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Health
<ul>
<li>This was a slightly more difficult category, since many (most) of 				them related to sex in one form or another, but since they were not in and of 				themselves pornographic in nature I felt they should be elsewhere, and this 				seemed an appropriate place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hardware/software related
<ul>
<li>This covered everything from cell phones to virus checking 				software and all points in between.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attract a partner
<ul>
<li>Several of these were related to hypnotising a woman into bed 				(though 'you're getting very sleepy' would seem to be a little self defeating, 				I would have thought), while others were about using scent, chat up lines and 				so on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Earn a degree
<ul>
<li>Or a diploma. Or a Masters. Or a doctorate. Or... you get the 				idea.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Holidays
<ul>
<li>In the sun. Or the snow. Or in the far east, or anywhere at all 				apparently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Miscellaneous
<ul>
<li>A complete lucky bag of the strange and downright wierd. Back to 				septic tanks again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I could have broken these categories down even further, but 		as I said earlier, I have a life. They're good enough for me, and if you don't 		like them you're more than welcome to try your own spam experiment.</p>
<p>For those of you without a morbid interest in figures, the two outright 		'winners' are money and sex. No big surprise there, but if you'd been expecting 		one I have to tell you that you don't know much about humankind. The actual 		breakdown is as follows:</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Financial</td>
<td>231</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pornographic</td>
<td>185</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Health</td>
<td>108</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Misc.</td>
<td>57</td>

<tr>
<td>Hardware/<br />

<tr>
<td>Attracting a partner</td>
<td>40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Getting a degree</td>
<td>40</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Holidays</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I was slightly surprised at the results, since I'd always assumed that I 		got more pornographic spam than anything else (who knows - maybe I do!) but 		clearly this wasn't the case here - financial spam came way out on top of the 		list. What I did find interesting was that I didn't get a single 'Nigerian 		letter' offering me a share of $50,000,000, yet I often get several of these a 		day in my usual email account. So quite where these come from (and don't say 		'Nigeria') I have no clue at all.</p>
<h2>So where did the spam come from?</h2>
<p>At last I was in a position to find out. The weeks of waiting, tossing 		and turning in bed, and counting spam emails instead of sheep was coming to an 		end. Eagerly I added up my columns of figures, desperate to reach a conclusion. 		Alright - it's not amazingly exciting, but I'm doing my best, ok? Actually, it 		was rather surprising.</p>
<table border="1">

</table>
<p>By far and away the most spam came as a result of requesting not to 		receive anymore! This wasn’t actually that surprising, since I had a 		feeling that would be the case. However, the fact that a single posting to 		LIS-LINK resulted in 244 spam emails quite astonished me; almost 7 times the 		amount that I got from the pornographic site. (I should point out here that to 		be fair I discounted all the actual pornographic emails that I was sent, since 		I had in a way requested them – I just counted as spam anything that 		wasn’t pornography, ironically enough.) I was also surprised that my 		single posting to the Yahoo! group didn't result in any spam at all - perhaps I 		was just fortunate with the group that I chose.</p>
<p>I’m not going to pretend that my experiment was particularly 		scientific, but then it wasn’t really intended to be. However, I think it 		was rigorous enough to draw some interesting conclusions from it. Firstly, 		under no circumstances should you respond to a spam email and ask to be taken 		off a list. While you may get taken off that specific list it’s quite 		clear that you’re going to be added to plenty of others! Secondly, and 		perhaps rather worryingly, it does appear (from a spam standpoint) to be a very 		bad idea to post to mailing lists; certainly not those that have publically 		available archives. I don’t image that a spammer has actually bothered to 		join the list, but I think it’s more than possible that they send software 		to crawl through the archives and collect email addresses which are then added 		to their lists. Consequently, the more that you post, the more likely it is 		that you’re going to get spam – and quite a lot of it!</p>
<h2>So who are the spam winners and losers?</h2>
<p>Well, that's a question that I can give a very quick and easy answer to; 		we're the losers. Anyone with an email address that is publically available on 		the Internet is almost certainly going to get spam at some point. Probably 		sooner rather than later I'm afraid to say. And the winners? Anyone who has 		managed to sell a septic tank across the Internet I should imagine!</p>
