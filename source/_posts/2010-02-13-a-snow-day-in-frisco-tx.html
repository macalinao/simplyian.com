<p>Yesterday, today, and the day before yesterday, there was actually snow in Frisco, Texas! I don't mean the usual 1 inch of snow, but a <strong><em>freaking 4 inches!</em></strong> Amazing, right?</p>
<p>But do you know what's even more amazing? <a href="http://www.dylanmacalinao.com">My brother</a> and I built a huge tower complete with a staircase!<br />

<p>The tower was approximately 3 meters tall and made completely out of snow. It took 7 man-hours of development.</p>
<h2>What was the process in building this monster?</h2>
<p>First, we started way in the backyard (shown in the picture at the bottom-left) and rolled a huge snowball to make our base. (above picture) Then, we packed snow under it to keep it from rolling around. After that, we started to make a snowman. The snowman never really worked out, so we decided to build a tower.</p>
<p>We did build the tower on the first day of snow, but overnight, the whole thing fell apart.</p>
<p>Later, we decided to build a staircase out of snow since our dad wasn't helping us anymore because of his work. The staircase, I repeat, was made completely out of snow and each step could support my whole weight.</p>
<p>We made the tower a little bit shorter than it is in the picture then went inside to eat lunch.</p>
<p>Going back outside, we learned that the whole top half of the tower had been destroyed. I then alone rebuilt part of the tower and added two new steps to the staircase. After that, my brother came outside and started to hand me snow so I wouldn't have to keep going down and up over and over again. Eventually, though, my brother took a long 30 minute break so I built the rest of the tower to what is is now.</p>
<p>(By the way, my brother was trying to climb up the steep front side of the sculpture and eventually succeeded.)</p>
<p>After all the muddy work, we finally took a break, took our showers, and fell asleep. Today, it is still standing tall and proud. :)</p>
