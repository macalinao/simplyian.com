<p>You know you're a geek when...</p>
<ul>
<li>You know Esperanto or Lojban.</li>
<li>You type in Dvorak (or even geekier, Colemak (or even geekier, QGMLWY)).</li>
<li>You prefer the Dymaxion projection for maps.</li>
<li>You prefer writing integers in base 16 even when not dealing with bitwise operations.</li>
<li>You know what Malbolge is.</li>
<li>You are on Github more than you are on Facebook.</li>
<li>You use Vim because it's so much easier than a different text editor.</li>
<li>You prefer TeX over Word.</li>
<li>When saying "What's Up", you reply that up is a relative direction.</li>
<li>You hate Finder; "cd" and "ls" are all you need.</li>
<li>You find yourself saying "sudo" when things don't go your way.</li>
<li>Mac &lt; Windows &lt; Ubuntu &lt; Arch Linux</li>
</ul>
<p>Things missing? I'm sure there are a lot. Comment below!</p>
