I have. Well guess what? There's a free tool available online that lets you come up with blog posts pertaining to a topic! It's called <a href="http://linkbaitgenerator.com/">Linkbait Generator</a>.<br />
<!--more--><br />
To use Linkbait Generator, you click the generate button. To use your own subject, you may input either "singular" or "plural" subjects. It's pretty straightforward; not much to say about it.</p>
<p>They have an option of blogging on their site, which I think is stupid. To each his own, though.</p>
<p>I have used this to write a few of my blog posts.</p>
<p><em>How about you?</em></p>
