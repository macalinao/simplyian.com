<p>Well, you may wonder why I am blogging, so I'll tell you now. Blogging is another form of mass media, so that is why I am blogging. I want to demonstrate my views on topics and tutorials on how to establish goals. Also, I want to learn how to write well. I am in GT English at my school, but yeah, this is a really bad piece of writing as you can see. My writing style will try to improve every day as I will get new topics to write about every day. (oops i repeated) So yeah.... This is my blog, and I hope one day 'll be writing 2 page blog posts a day since I have all the time in the world... anywho, please read my <a href="http://i.dcritic.com/about-me/" target="_self">About Me</a> page to learn more about me.</p>
