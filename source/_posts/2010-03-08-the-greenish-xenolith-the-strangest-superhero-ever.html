<p><span class="drop_cap">O</span>ne day in GT class, we were assigned to create superheroes based on word stems that we were at the time learning. I created a very cliche one, Atmoman. He could control the atmosphere, make wind, etc. Other people created slightly weirder ones, such as Picoman, a superhero who is so tiny enemies cannot spot him. But one cannot even comprehend the unthinkable superhero -- one that is not even a superhero in most minds: the <strong>GREENISH XENOLITH</strong>.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>What is a greenish xenolith, you ask? Let me quote Austin's almost exact words.</p>
<blockquote><p>(In the background) <em>Let's get this over with already...</em></p>
<p>(Stands)</p>
<p>My hero is called a greenish xenolith.</p>
<p>When a good guy steps on it, it teleports them.</p>
<p>When a bad guy steps on it, it blows them up.</p>
<p>The stem is "xeno" and it means stranger.</p>
<p>(talking to himself) <em>That was ridiculous.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What did I say? It's a tool!</p>
<p>The greenish xenolith is a strange type of superhero. Why? It cannot move on its own. It cannot think for itself. It can only tell good from bad. How is that a superhero? According to Austin, because it kills bad guys, it's a superhero. By definition, a superhero is "a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers; <em>also</em> <strong>:</strong> an exceptionally skillful or successful person" according to Merriam-Webster. Does this fall into that category? Well let's see.</p>
<p>A fictional hero...</p>
<h3>Yes, it's completely made up, and it is a hero because it saves good guys from bad guys.</h3>
<p>...having extraordinary or superhuman powers.</p>
<h3>Teleporting is superhuman, even though the greenish xenolith ISN'T human.</h3>
<p>And a hero is:</p>
<h3>A mythological or legendary figure often of divine descent endowed with great strength or ability.</h3>
<p>It is a figure, technically. Yes it does have great ability.</p>
<p>So, it fits the definitions. Although it isn't what the public perceives as a "superhero", it still is one. Heroes do not always have to be human; they just have to do good things.</p>
<p>Here's a real-life picture of a greenish xenolith:</p>

<p>I'll post more about it eventually, once I can get a hold of the greenish xenolith comic. In the meantime, just wait!</p>
<p>So what do you think?</p>
<p><strong><em>Is the greenish xenolith a superhero?</em></strong></p>
