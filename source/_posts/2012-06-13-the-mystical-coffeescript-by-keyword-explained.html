<p>Coffeescript is an amazing language. As a matter of fact, it's my favorite language. Here's some recent code I used to split up one array into a multidimensional array with a certain number of columns.</p>
<p>[code lang="ruby"]<br />
matrix.push arr[i..(i + cols - 1)] for i in [0..arr.length - 1] by cols<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Notice the second to last keyword: <code>by</code>.</p>
<p>The `by` keyword basically changes the increment of the generated for loop. Without the `by`, you'd have `i++` as the increment of your for loop. However, with the `by`, you'd instead have `i += 3` if you had `by 3`.</p>
<p>Here's a simple example where I am getting money out of my bank account in the form of 5 dollar bills.</p>
<p>[code lang="ruby"]<br />
console.log &quot;I have #{i} dollars.&quot; for i in [0..100] by 5<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>This translates to the following Javascript:</p>
<p>[code lang="js"]<br />
var i;<br />
for (i = 0; i &lt;= 100; i += 5) {<br />
  console.log(&quot;I have &quot; + i + &quot; dollars.&quot;);<br />
}<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>As you can see, the increment of the loop is now 5 rather than just 1.</p>
<p>Now the question is, are there any other hidden features of Coffeescript like this?</p>
