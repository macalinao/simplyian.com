I had a few exams this week involving reading etc. But one of the biggest things I've been doing is reviving my old website, <a href="http://www.clububer.com/">Club Uber</a>. Club Uber was my first PHP-powered website designed in 2007-2008. Recently, though, I have been working on my latest website, D Critic. Therefore, Club Uber was abandoned. Now I am racing to get it to the status it was at before: active.<br />

<h2>The origins of Club Uber</h2>
<p>Back in 2007, I was working on making a website that my friends would actually like. My older websites were all pure CONTENT-- no games, no chatting, no nothing. Later I discovered that content could be dynamic using PHP. I used the Fantastico installer to install my first installation of PHP-Fusion. I looked to see REAL programming! HTML was like a second language to me at the time and I found it boring. After seeing what programming is, I decided to edit code.</p>
<p>The programming language of PHP was relatively easy to understand. It was mostly in English. The code of PHP-Fusion was VERY poorly-written and very easy to understand unlike Wordpress. I eventually learned it over the summer of 2007.</p>
<p>The first Club Uber featured a chatroom, messaging, and forums. Unfortunately, it was missing many big things that people wanted -- games. I did add games eventually and the site became a hit.</p>
<p>At the height of its popularity, I would have had about 20 users logging in every day with 4 users staying on during the entire summer of 2008. My site was incredibly huge and quickly bypassed the 500,000 visits mark.</p>
<p>Then I learned about WoW. I was addicted and stopped posting to the site. Eventually, the site expired in 2009 and all was lost.</p>
<p>Today I present to you the Club Uber from the summer of 2008. I really hope you make this site a hit once again. Make it work.</p>
<h2>In a nutshell, what is Club Uber?</h2>
<p>Club Uber is a gaming paradise.</p>
