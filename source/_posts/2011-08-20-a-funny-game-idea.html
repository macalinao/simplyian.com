<p><span class="drop_cap">T</span>he other day, I was daydreaming and came up with a funny game which I call the "Computer Jargon" game. See if you can guess the references!<br />
<!--more--></p>
<ul>
<li>Trees that are Octrees</li>
<li>A bank with a wall made out of fire</li>
<li>A heap of dirt -- Big chunks of dirt on the top</li>
<li>A real tree with branches only leading to objects at the tips of branches (and at splits)</li>
<li>A library filled with packages (hahahahaha)</li>
<li>Indonesia being full of programmers</li>
<li>A pet python which you can script to do stuff</li>
<li>Colored, 4-pane windows</li>
<li>To "bash" someone you have to type a command in chat</li>
<li>Red gemstones that do some scripted stuff</li>
<li>A bus company named "Universal Serial"</li>
<li>Many, many more things...</li>
</ul>
<div>Maybe this should be some sort of flash game. Programmer's game? I don't know, but it'll really be funny if I do decide to make it! The goal of this game is to refer to as many programming and computer-related references as possible. Make it an MMO? I don't know. What I do know is that it should be an RPG. Also, I need to learn more programming terms... all I know is I really want to make this game some time.</div>
