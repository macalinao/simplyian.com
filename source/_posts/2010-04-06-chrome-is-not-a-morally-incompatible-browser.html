I naturally went to the first result and what did I get? Some crap about Google Chrome being a "Morally Incompatible Browser"!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://i.dcritic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/morally-incompatible-browser-detected-5ubliminal.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-659" title="Morally Incompatible Browser Detected - 5ubliminal" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/morally-incompatible-browser-detected-5ubliminal.jpg" alt="Morally Incompatible Browser Detected - 5ubliminal" width="484" height="311" /></a></p>
<p>The page claims that Opera, Firefox, and IE are all morally compatible. It then has the nerve to say to "Please use a real browser"!</p>
<p>Why? Maybe because Google is so big already and is expanding to every market?</p>
<p>But why MSIE? That browser <a href="http://i.dcritic.com/2010/01/03/7-reasons-why-not-to-use-internet-explorer/">really sucks</a>! Microsoft is also a huge comglomerate!</p>
<p>So how is it morally incompatible?</p>
<p>It's kinda dumb to do this anyway on a blog because of the high market share of Google Chrome.</p>
<p><strong>5ubliminal</strong>, please explain yourself.</p>
<p>I mean, really? That's a neck.</p>
