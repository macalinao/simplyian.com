<p>Tonight, they sang "Rock that Body" to promote Idol Gives Back. It probably kept donors from donating, though.</p>

<p>See what I mean? Maybe apl.de.ap's mic was lagged or Fergie's mic was rigged. Yes, apl.de.ap was late almost every time. Maybe the sound guys didn't adjust the system for an entire group of people. Nevertheless, the performance looked horrible on screen.</p>
<p>Or maybe they didn't want to donate.</p>
<p>What do you think of this performance?</p>
