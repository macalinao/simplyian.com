title: Why you shouldn't bring new programmers to a hackathon

Hackathons don't create new hackers.

In the many hackathons I've attended over the past semester, I've brought several beginners (people who knew basic Python or C++) to them before. And to be honest, they were not able to get anything out of them. They didn't really know where to start or what they were supposed to be doing. They don't know what a GET request is, or an HTTP request, or even HTTP. All they knew were things about algorithms: how quicksort operates, the difference between a LinkedList and an ArrayList, and other things not related to actual software engineering.

The truth of the matter is that **non-hackers should not go to hackathons.**

If all of one's knowledge of computer science is from class, I don't think that a hackathon is a good place for them to be because they won't be able to get the most out of their hackathon experience. They won't know how to provision a server to host the app. They won't even know how to start creating an application in the first place. Recognizing that they can't contribute anything to the project, they feel useless (which to some extent is true).

Instead, you should seek out the people who are already making things: **people who are already programming using real-world technologies.** Find people who have been making websites or apps, and convince them to travel and get free food to build something cool over a caffeinated and high energy weekend. Anyone who has knowledge of *anything* outside of class -- whether it's basic PHP, a simple mobile app, or even just HTML -- will be able to get something out of a hackathon, as unlike the typical freshman computer science major, they will be actually be able to do things.

Hackathons don't create new hackers, but they guide and motivate existing hackers with potential.

Don't bring beginners to a hackathon. Bring people who will actually be able to make something of the experience.
