<p><a href="http://i.dcritic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/code.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-872" title="code" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/code-300x187.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="187" /></a><span class="drop_cap">I</span>'ve decided to take up Python as a hobby. Why? In school, we use Macs. Netbeans is hard to close quickly, but the terminal has almost instant loading. I can basically just type "python test.py" and there you go, the file is running. Plus, I've always wanted to use Vim. (I actually use MacVim; the built in Vim has no syntax highlighting, full screen mode, etc.) So to learn Python faster, I'm doing all of the Project Euler problems when class gets really slow.<br />
<!--more--><br />
The code:</p>
<pre>
import time
starttime = time.time()

def isPalindrome(s):
	if s == s[::-1]:
		return True
	else:
		return False

i = 100
j = 100
greatest = 0
while (i &lt;= 999):
	while (j &lt;= 999):
		product = i * j
		if (product &gt; greatest and isPalindrome(str(product))):
			greatest = product
		j += 1
	j = 100
	i += 1
print "Greatest value found: " + str(greatest)
finishtime = time.time()
print "Execution time: " + str(finishtime - starttime) + " seconds"
</pre>
<p>If you have any suggestions for how I could improve this, I'd appreciate it.</p>
<p>If you have a good syntax highlighting plugin for Wordpress, that'd be good too.</p>
