Therefore, for class, we had to design personal ads for characters. I chose to do the Count of Monte Cristo himself. Here's my very strange and unusual ad. Please feel free to comment on it. I need criticism right now.<br />

<h2><a href="http://i.dcritic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/comc.bmp"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-363" title="The Count of Monte Cristo" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/comc.bmp" alt="The Count of Monte Cristo" width="296" height="369" /></a>The Count of Monte Cristo</h2>
<p>28 Rue de la Fontaine, Auteuil, Paris, France</p>
<p>Age: 33 years old</p>
<h2>My passion</h2>
<p>I am most passionate about doing what is right. Justice is something that I will always fight for. The selfish and envious should be punished for their wrongs against the righteous and humble. As the saying goes, “An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.”</p>
<h2>The top three things I am thankful for:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Having enough wealth to be able to do what I please</li>
<li>Good friends</li>
<li>Being free of any prisons of any sort</li>
</ol>
<h2>My friends describe me as:</h2>
<ul>
<li>As noble as a Borghese</li>
<li>Mysterious</li>
<li>Empathetic</li>
</ul>
<h2>What I look for in a partner</h2>
<p>I look for honesty and compassion. I also value beauty greatly, but a good character is much more important. My partner should be completely loyal to me and not cheat on me at all.</p>
<h2>An ideal date</h2>
<p>An ideal date for me would be a peaceful cruise alone in the Mediterranean Sea underneath a clear blue sky. We would sail to the Isle of Monte Cristo and talk there, far from other people.</p>
<h2>The first thing you will notice about me</h2>
<p>I am always dressed nicely and appropriately. When I talk, my voice seems very commanding and powerful to anyone I speak to. I seem very intelligent and knowledgeable about everything. I am very kind to kind people and not as kind to the rude. I help others in need when they are in distress unless they have not been nice to me.</p>
<h2>How I spend my leisure time</h2>
<p>I usually host or attend parties to socialize and learn more about others. When not at banquets, I try to learn as much as possible to seem better-rounded.</p>
