<p><a href="http://i.dcritic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/158228-Google-Music-Beta-Icon.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1095" title="158228-Google-Music-Beta-Icon" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/158228-Google-Music-Beta-Icon.png" alt="" width="256" height="256" /></a>Many people don't know that Google offers a free cloud service that lets you store your music on Google's servers, freeing up a lot of space on your Android phone. This service, <a href="https://play.google.com/music/">Google Music</a>, lets you store up to 20,000 songs with Google and lets you listen to these songs virtually anywhere. Here's how to get started.</p>
<h1>Step 1: Sign up for Google Music</h1>
<p>First you need to sign up for this service by going to the <a href="http://play.google.com/music/">Google Music website</a> and sign up.</p>
<h1>Step 2: Install Music Manager and choose the folders you want synced</h1>
<p>Once you sign up just click 'Upload music,' download the Music Manager, and install it. This will sync wherever your music is stored on your computer with your Google account, allowing you to listen to your music anywhere.</p>
<h1>Step 3: Install the "Google Music" app for Android</h1>
<p>The Google Music app, found in the Play store, allows you to listen to the music stored on your Google account. Instead of storing the music on your phone, playing a song through this app lets you stream your music from Google. There is also a handy widget that comes with the app showing you what you are listening to.</p>
<p>Google Music is a very useful app as it frees up a large amount of space from your phone, especially if your music collection is extensive. You can also listen to your music from your computer via the Google Music website. A very awesome plus is that you can directly buy music from the Google Play store and have the music transferred to your account practically instantly -- no need to download beforehand as it's all stored with Google anyway! Enjoy having one music library available everywhere!</p>
