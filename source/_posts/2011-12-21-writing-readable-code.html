<p><span class="drop_cap">W</span>riting readable code is something you don't really see. After all, it's <strong>code</strong>. Take HTML for example. Lots of strange tags to remember, formatting, and lots of trial and error. HTML/XML isn't really the most readable thing.<br />
<!--more--><br />
Or take the following:</p>
<pre lang="java">public class SkillCharge extends TargettedSkill {
    public SkillCharge(Heroes plugin) {
        super(plugin, "Charge");
        setDescription("Charges towards your target");
        setUsage("/skill charge");
        setArgumentRange(0, 1);
        setIdentifiers("skill charge");
        setTypes(SkillType.PHYSICAL, SkillType.MOVEMENT, SkillType.HARMFUL);
    }
}</pre>
<p>I mean, it's decent. But it isn't readable to <strong>anyone</strong> who sees the file. By anyone, I mean a non-programmer. Now take this:</p>
<pre lang="java">public class FlameShield extends Skill {
	public FlameShield(Attribute attribute) {
		super(attribute);

		id(0x02);
		name("Flame Shield");
		description("For 10...45 seconds (linear), anything that harms you is set ablaze for 2...5 seconds (linear).");
	}
}</pre>
<p>The only really confusing thing there is the id, but I'm a programmer, so naturally I feel good with hex. But look at this:</p>
<blockquote><p>For 10...45 seconds (linear), anything that harms you is set ablaze for 2...5 seconds (linear).</p></blockquote>
<p>Does that seem like code to you? Here's what it does: it draws a line between 10 and 45 and compares your level as a percentage between those two numbers. But it's readable to the normal human!</p>
<p>The only problem with this is having more advanced logic behind the scenes. I had to write something that takes a percentage and turns it into something based on a graph. But that doesn't matter. Why?</p>
<h2>As much of your code as possible should be written for humans.</h2>
<p>The brain reads faster in its native language -- usually plain English. Plus, when other people need to use your code, they'll understand it. Of course, you shouldn't sacrifice readability for a large performance hit.</p>
