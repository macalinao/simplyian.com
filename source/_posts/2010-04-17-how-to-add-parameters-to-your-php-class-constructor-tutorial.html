<p><a href="http://i.dcritic.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/php.gif"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-707" title="PHP" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/php.gif" alt="PHP" width="120" height="67" /></a><span class="drop_cap">T</span>here are not many tutorials on this other than forum posts. The other day, I was searching for "<strong>PHP class add parameters</strong>" and nothing came up. It was after reading about <strong>how to use PHP class constructors</strong> that I was actually able to do this. Constructors define how your class is created and can also have parameters. In essence, they make your classes modifiable.<br />
<!--more--> Constructors can be used for a variety of reasons. In my case, I needed it to connect to a database. Instead of using a function and a class, I combined my function into a constructor. For this reason, I will show you how to use a class to connect to a database as an example.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Create the __construct() function in your class</h2>
<p>I named my class icdb. You can, however, name it anything you want.</p>
<pre name="code" class="php">class icdb {
	function __construct() {
	}
}</pre>
<h2>Step 2: Add parameters to the __construct() function</h2>
<p>Add parameters to this like any other function.</p>
<pre name="code" class="php">function __construct($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass, $db_name) {
}</pre>
<h2>Step 3: Make your function</h2>
<p>Do whatever you want. Here I am connecting to a database, obviously.</p>
<pre name="code" class="php">function __construct($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass, $db_name) {
	global $db_prefix;
	$link = mysql_connect($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass);
	$db = mysql_select_db($db_name);
	$this-&gt;prefix = $db_prefix;
	return $link;
}</pre>
<h2>Step 4: Add legacy support for PHP4</h2>
<p>PHP 4 handles constructors differently. You must create a function with the name of your class within your class. Here, I must make the function icdb().</p>
<pre name="code" class="php">function icdb() {
	$this-&gt;__construct();
}</pre>
<h2>Final Code</h2>
<p>You're now done! Here's all of the code put together.</p>
<pre name="code" class="php">class icdb {
	function icdb() {
		$this-&gt;__construct();
	}

	function __construct($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass, $db_name) {
		global $db_prefix;
		$link = mysql_connect($db_host, $db_user, $db_pass);
		$db = mysql_select_db($db_name);
		$this-&gt;prefix = $db_prefix;
		return $link;
	}
}</pre>
<p>And to initialize the class:</p>
<pre name="code" class="php">$icdb = new icdb("localhost", "myUser", "myPass", "myDb");</pre>
<p>And that's it! You are now connected to a database. Now all you need is to add functions to the class to work with the database!</p>
<p>You can use this method to add parameters to any PHP class.</p>
