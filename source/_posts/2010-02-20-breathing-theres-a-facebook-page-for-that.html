<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-423" href="http://i.dcritic.com/2010/02/20/breathing-theres-a-facebook-page-for-that/breathing-facebook-page/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-423" title="The Facebook Page for Breathing" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/breathing-facebook-page-300x180.jpg" alt="The Facebook Page for Breathing" width="300" height="180" /></a><span class="drop_cap">A</span>pple. There's an app for that. Verizon. There's a map for that. Facebook? There's a page for that. Some are completely legit, such as a page for Facebook or a page for your city or even a page for your school district. But then comes the pages that clog up Facebook's servers: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Breathing/8181624724">Breathing</a>. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/sleeping/140262580443">Sleeping</a>. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Sleeping-with-one-leg-out-of-the-covers/92775959070">Sleeping with one leg out of the covers</a>. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/College-Ruled-Paper/117360413315">College-Ruled Pape</a>r. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Not-Becoming-A-Fan-Of-Everything/77799239326">Not "Becoming A Fan" Of Everything</a>. (Hypocrite!)</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Seriously, you know the people who become a fan of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/facebook-is-two-slow/127326524099">Facebook being too slow</a>? The reason Facebook has gotten so slow is because of both AJAX, Javascript, and an overload of pages/groups! Sure someone may have a good reason to have a page, such as to promote a business or page, but this is a step too far. This is why Facebook is so slow, people. Pages like this use up all of the database memory and power. Even apps don't drag Facebook this slow; most requests and files come from other websites!</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-428" href="http://i.dcritic.com/2010/02/20/breathing-theres-a-facebook-page-for-that/trying-to-put-a-tshirt-on-without-messing-up-your-hair/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-428" title="Trying to Put a T-Shirt On Without Messing Up Your Hair" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/trying-to-put-a-tshirt-on-without-messing-up-your-hair.jpg" alt="Trying to Put a T-Shirt On Without Messing Up Your Hair" width="222" height="208" /></a>Here's one I recently found which 20 of my friends are already fans of: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Trying-To-Put-On-A-T-shirt-Without-Messing-Up-Your-Hair/431455495003">Trying To Put On A T-shirt Without Messing Up Your Hair</a>. Don't we all do that? If I'm not a fan of it, does that mean I don't care about my hair? Does that mean I'm a messy person? They even created an image for the purpose of this page.</p>
<p>Another example is "<a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Questions-on-a-test-that-give-away-the-answers-to-other-questions/193650527225">Questions on a test that give away the answers to other questions</a>". If I don't become a fan of this, does this mean that I don't like getting questions right? Does this mean that I like hard questions? Does this mean I want to fail class? Sooner or later, we all become fans of questions like this. Do we have to be fans?</p>
<p>What is really annoying is those groups which ask you to invite all of your friends. Request spam, etc, is all over the place. The other day, I was invited to "Texas, the bipolar state" and "February 11, 2010. The day it snowed 4 inches in Frisco."</p>
<p>Seriously, page spam and random friending has to stop. These create nuisances all over the place -- on walls, in messages, requests, etc.</p>
<p>If you really want to become a fan of sleeping, sleep instead of spamming us.</p>
<p>I really think that Facebook should start approving pages.</p>
<p><em>How about you?</em></p>
