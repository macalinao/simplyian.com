<p><span class="drop_cap">I</span>f you still remember the site "Club Uber", this was one of the most popular games on the site. Obviously, it's REALLY addicting. The controls are simple: click to move up, release to fall. Try not to run into anything or you will explode!</p>
<p>This game was originally released by the blog SeeThru, but they have been dead for a while now.</p>
<p>Try to see if you can only play one game!</p>
