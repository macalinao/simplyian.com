Hi, I'm Ian Macalinao. I am an 18-year-old student currently in the TAMS program at the University of North Texas.

I go by the names **simplyianm** and  **AlbireoX** on the internet. **simplyianm** originated from me brainstorming a name that I could use for the rest of my life in 7th grade. **AlbireoX** came from me thinking of a cool Grepolis name in 9th grade. Originally Albireo, I renamed myself to AlbireoX because Albireo was taken everywhere.

I do a lot of Java development, specifically [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org). I've been programming for Minecraft-related things on and off since 9th grade. I currently program for [Original MC](http://og-site.net).

## Contact
My email address is [ian@giza.us](mailto:ian@giza.us), my phone number is (530) 426-2146, and my Skype is `simplyianm`.
